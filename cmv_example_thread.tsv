"It sounds to me as though you have a somewhat misinformed understanding about what feminists mean when they use the term ""rape culture"". Obviously, I can't speak for what everyone means when they use it, but let me at least try to broaden the scope of the term a little bit.

First off, of course society explicitly expresses contempt for rapists. This isn't what the term means. ""Rape culture"" does not refer to explicit views. Instead, it refers to the mixed messages that get expressed with regard to sexual assault, harassment, and consent. Here are a few examples:
* Despite a strong intolerance for rape, the notion of active consent is rarely an active discussion topic; in books about how to teach your children about sex, teaching them about the importance of consent is often not a strong priority.

* Despite strong explicit views about rape, when high-profile cases of rape occur, sometimes individuals are quick to excuse the rapists for other reasons (e.g., celebrity status; sporting achievements; academic tenure; notions of the victim ""deserving it"" because of clothing choices, intoxication, or past sexual promiscuity).

* Strong cultural norms regarding relationships and sex teach women to play ""hard to get"" (i.e., say ""no"" when they mean ""yes""), and teach men to ignore initial negative responses to persuade women to say ""yes"". As a source, watch virtually any romance movie ever.

* Despite the fact that most sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows, rape is often portrayed in a ""stranger-in-the-bushes"" kind of way. This allows individuals who violate consent to consider themselves ""not rapists"", because they are not specifically targeting strangers.

As I hope I've made clear with these few examples, the idea of ""rape culture"" is not about a culture that explicitly endorses rape. It's about a culture that *says* it abhors it, while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault. Note that this doesn't mean there are people out there that actually are trying to ensure that people are sexually assaulted; it just means that, out of ignorance or support of the status quo, we as a society end up reinforcing these norms and institutions, to our own detriment."	cl7nh5y	t3_2j196u	jeffhughes	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future.

"Regarding the rapists as strangers thing:

I'm female. I was raised female. I have an older brother.

When I was traveling from my home back to University one evening, I had a tire blow out while on the freeway. I pulled over and called AAA, and then I called my mother.

The first thing she did, after asking if I was okay, was to tell me to get in my car and lock the doors and not to open the car until the AAA guy came, and to make sure I asked him for identification and that I verified that he was who he said he was, and that she was on her way to meet me (I would have to get a new tire, and at the time she was taking care of a lot of the larger car stuff).

She was also always very *very* worried when I stayed in the city too long, and didn't leave for University until later in the afternoon or evening - because I would be driving in the dark.

She never expressed these concerns to my brother, even when he was the same age as I was at the time, and even though at the time he was known for having much riskier behavior than I was. When I eventually confronted my mother about it, her only reasoning was ""Well, he's a boy.""

This is the sort of thing that people talk about when they mention attackers being depicted as hiding in the bushes. My mother never talked to me about date rape, or the fact that I was - and am - much more likely to be assaulted by someone I know and trust and have allowed into my life than by someone I don't know who is just waiting in a dark alley for a victim. This is true for men as well as women, but when it comes to sexual assault ...

I grew up being *terrified* of men, simply because it was a possibility that they *could* rape me. This was fostered in me by my mother and father. From the time that my dad bought me pepper spray, to my mother having a curfew on me up until I was 23 and married and moved out. Every aspect of my life, for a really long time, was driven by this idea that I had to keep myself ""pure""."	cl7y05f	t1_cl7sqiq	washichiisai	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

There seems to be a lot of variance regarding how accused men are treated. You'd hardly say that the boys of Steubenville were crucified, for instance. My point isn't so much about rapists who are brought to trial - by that point they would seem to have been found guilty by the court of public opinion, I don't deny it, which is clearly not great either. It's more about the other ones. All the men accused by women on reddit, whose accusers are habitually disbelieved (happens almost every day, it seems). Disregarding a woman's personal boundaries is too easily seen as not rape at all, just something boys do.	cl88237	t1_cl87u3a	sensitivePornGuy	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"But you are cherry picking the example of Steubenville, as they *were* crucified in the court of public opinion or you wouldn't even know about them.

With the knowledge in mind that you can reference them as rapists online and reasonably expect other US citizens to know what you are talking about shows that they are being held accountable, if not by their local community by a majority of people who know the story.

Additionally, You acknowledge that there is a lot of variance regarding how men are treated, and on top of that you exclude ""rapists who are brought to trial"" targeting only 

&gt;Men who have been accused by women of rape on the internet

Do you see why this is a limited group? What ever happened to Innocent until proven guilty? Why do you trust random internet women more than you trust random internet men? shouldn't they be equivalent? There isn't even a way to verify gender short of revealing a large amount of personal information.

You present your argument such that, this is the group you have the most problem with, and then generalize that 

&gt;Disregarding a woman's personal boundaries is too easily seen as ... just something boys do.

By who? is this a feeling you have? anecdotal evidence?'

Please don't perpetuate the myth that ""rape is only something men do to women"", especially if its not something you agree with.

A rapist can be a person of either gender, and what gender they are has little effect on how horrific the results of their actions are.

"&gt; I'm not sure if I'm interpreting your comment right, but are you agreeing with the advice listed in parenthesis? That seems a bit shitty and thinking spawned from rape culture.

You get similar advice, be you man or woman, about walking alone through shady parts of Detroit.

I think it is unrealistically idealistic to tell people ""Don't follow that advise! Nay, you should wear clothes made out of hundred dollar bills and yell about how heavy all of your jewelry feels while you frolic in the alleyways!"" and that if doing so is not safe that we live in a ""mugging culture"" and that some specific skin color with a statistic of being 10 times more likely to be convicted of violent crime than other skin colors ought to be held accountable or that Detroit is a ""Blackriarchy"".

Here is what I think is healthy instead: We recognize that X% of *human beings* are liable to commit crimes, be that theft or rape. It's a failure rate. While we can work to reduce that failure rate (which [we've been very successful at](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1993-2012.xls) over the past generation or so), it is **unrealistic** to hold society to a standard of 0% crime.

That X% offender rate is very very small, and further splitting that hair into gender or race informs us of virtually *nothing* about the larger populations of gender or race in general.

"It's less that people explicitly state ""She totally deserved it"" - although that does happen - and more that they imply it with their words and what they do.

For example, in November 2010 an eleven year old girl was sexually assaulted by eighteen older men. The New York Times article about the attack added this: *""They said she dressed older than her age, wearing makeup and fashions more appropriate to a woman in her 20s. She would hang out with teenage boys at a playground, some said.""* [article about the article here](http://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/new_york_times_blames_11_year_old_rape_victim/).

And you have to understand, this isn't a one-off thing. Women who report being raped are often asked what they were wearing when the incident occurred. Women who dress sexy might be accused of ""leading on"" the assailant - and then have it turned around ""Well that's what happens when you dress like a whore"".

I tend to see the clothes thing more in statutory rape cases and not as much in forceable rape. Not saying it doesn't happen, but in statutory rape cases it does make sense that a person would say that as a defense (you would think a 15 yr old couldn't get into a bar and be safe to not card everyone they sleep with when they are consenting (ignoring the fact minors can't consent)). It's often still illegal despite this defense, but one would feel cheated by the system when they saw nothing wrong in their reasoning, not to argue on statutory rape laws but more to provide an example of when I hear the excuses.	cl80wt5	t1_cl7yf1h	Grave_Salad	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Is that literally what you hear people say, or is that your own interpretation of their words?

Adding the word ""deserve"" into it makes me wary. If it's people's own words that include ""deserve"", then fine, that is indeed heinous.

"To start, most of my experience with sexual assault, primary and secondary, is at the college campus level.

&gt;Is that literally what you hear people say, or is that your own interpretation of their words? 

Yes, but only once in my life, as you might expect people are pretty loathe to say that exact phrase verbatim because it's so so so obviously wrong. And people know it's obviously wrong, and they think rape is wrong, and they aren't bad people so they don't say or consciously believe that anyone should ever be raped for any reason. But despite that very obvious belief, I still have conversations like this:

**The situation:** A girl drank a lot at a party, passed out. Her friend left her completely knocked cold at the house, thought it would be okay. This is a house of friends and friends of friends. The passed out girl woke up that morning with no pants and a sore vagina in an upstairs bedroom, no memory of how she got there.

**Conversation:** (I'm streamlining here, all of this was said, but I'm compressing points  for length reasons. In reality this was probably over an hour) Person I'm talking to didn't know the guys involved, but had brothers who were friends with them. He started with something like ""she doesn't know if she was raped because she can't she can't remember anything that happened."" I say that's stupid on its own merits, and also point out that she was unconscious when her friend left, so how the hell did she end up where she ended up. We go around that for a while, eventually get to ""It was stupid for her to drink so much/her friend to leave her."" 

Me: What do you mean, it was a party, you're encouraged to be drinking!

P: That like the number one way to be raped. You should protect yourself, if you go to a slum wearing a rolex and get mugged, no one is surprised.

Me: She was in a house with friends. What should she have expected?

P: People are dangerous, that's all I'm saying.

Me: Okay, yes, I agree. But you seem like you're frustrated with her and I don't get that

P: It's just so dumb, like, what are you expecting?

Me: What are you saying, it's dumb, so she deserved it?

P: No, of course not.

Me: I don't think so either, so what are you saying.

P: I don't know, just, don't put yourself in a place like that.

And so on.

The point is this: ""She deserved it"" serves a function.  It allows you to dismiss the event. It lets you say be comfortable saying ""rape is bad"" but then not taking action when confronted with it. Mental gymnastics like the above serve **the same function**, they let you be complacent in the face of crime, but still maintain your innocence. That doesn't make the above person bad at their core (or any other part), but it does strengthen a culture of dismissal, and that is very dangerous. Identifying that doesn't require a mind-reader, just some skill at pattern recognition.

This relates directly to what you said about about ""deserve"" making a statement heinous or not heinous. They produce the same environment.

In further reference to heinous *v.* not heinous, I want to repeat: you don't have to be a bad person to a culture of dismissal, you just have to be someone that doesn't have to deal with rape frequently.

-----
For my own clarification-

&gt;To me, ""should statements"" don't necessarily assign moral blame

What is ""moral blame""? Do you mean responsibility? Because it definitely assigns that. Are you saying that should statements don't imply that someone made a good or bad choice? Because the word ""should"" is used to indicate correct action by it's definition. 


&gt;To me, ""should statements"" don't necessarily assign moral blame, **but do speak to causality**

I don't know how ""x is the cause of y"" is meaningfully different from ""x caused y"" is meaningfully  different from ""x is to blame for y."" 

I'm not totally clear on what this section of your post was getting at and need some expansion.

"I think the issue I have with your story is this: did the person think that the guys involved shouldn't have been found and punished if it was rape? Also, just because she was unconscious at one point during the night doesn't mean she couldn't have woken up several hours later an initiated sex.

There's a difference between saying the victim was really stupid about how they acted and excusing the perpetrators. If you go to a slum wearing a rolex and get mugged, there are going to be people saying you deserved to get mugged for acting so stupidly, but that's different than saying that what the mugger did was okay. You can think someone acted stupidly enough that they almost deserved the result of their actions, while at the same time thinking that the people who perpetrated the crimes should be punished to the full extent of the law."	cmwfdow	t1_cl82api	Siiimo	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

You're so right; sometimes you have to look behind people's words to get to what they really mean, especially with something so conflicted as rape. Yes, people generally mean well, and will have a belief that rape is bad and shouldn't be apologized for, yet they will find themselves doing it, perhaps even without realising, **precisely because rape culture does exist**. That's what it means, a culture that *unconsciously* normalizes or minimizes the seriousness of rape. Talking about it is the only real remedy, so that people can free themselves with the unconscious beliefs that they have been inhaling all their lives.	cl83sqi	t1_cl82api	sensitivePornGuy	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;This relates directly to what you said about about ""deserve"" making a statement heinous or not heinous. They produce the same environment.

Interesting. I'm going to mull over this for a while.

&gt;&gt;To me, ""should statements"" don't necessarily assign moral blame

&gt;What is ""moral blame""? Do you mean responsibility? Because it definitely assigns that.

If I walk into someone's unlocked house and steal their TV, I still carry *all* of the *moral* blame/responsibility for the theft. You could tell them, ""You should lock your front door if you don't want people to steal your stuff"" without placing *any* of the *moral* blame on them - it's still all on me. That particular should statement doesn't assign blame; it asserts another's agency. One *can* lock one's front door, and it *will* prevent me from simply walking in can carrying the TV out.

&gt;Because the word ""should"" is used to indicate correct action by it's definition. 

Only indirectly. ""Should"" is fundamentally about causality, not about correctness. ""If you want &lt;outcome X&gt;, you should &lt;action Y&gt;"". It presupposes that action Y is causally related to outcome X (and it's valid argumentation when talking about rape to attack this presupposition). ""Should"" only appears to be about correctness because very often the &lt;outcome X&gt; is a ""correct"" outcome!

&gt;I don't know how ""x is the cause of y"" is meaningfully different from ""x caused y"" is meaningfully different from ""x is to blame for y."" 

Yesterday I went outside to see why my dog was barking and while I was outside a bird shat on my head. My dog *caused* me to get shat on, but is not to *blame* for it. (Not a true story.)

Events can have multiple contributory causes. Interrupt any of those causes, and the event doesn't happen. That doesn't establish whether any of the agents (if any!) behind those causes carry and moral blame."	cl8kgcf	t1_cl82api	bpj1805	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"The argument is never ""She deserved to be raped because she was drunk!"". An argument is not worth your time if someone believes a woman ever deserves to be raped. That's just a retarded train of thought and shouldn't be entertained. 

The argument is ""Is consent is still consent while a woman is drunk?"". That's the debate.

"Thank you for clarifying. I'd still contend that non-mainstream views are worth considering when discussing how a culture handles an issue, but I see now that it's a bit tangential to your point.

As to whether drunken consent would still be considered consent, I would say that the responsibility for that falls on the person who makes the move to escalate the encounter. It's not rape to agree to have sex with a drunk person who's actively pursuing you. If one is initiating sex, however, a nod or word that would be consent from a sober person can't be equated with the same by a person with facilities impaired by alcohol."	cl8zcq8	t1_cl8ng02	Tarantio	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"OP was saying that lack of education and awareness about active consent lead to rape cases becoming muddled and excused (i.e. what they were wearing, were they drunk, etc).  In murder cases and theft cases, you might mention these things, but how often do people get away with theft or murder because of societies views on the victim?  And while murder is more serious of a crime, it also happens at a far lower rate than rape. 

There are certainly cultures that do perpetuate violence of other kinds.  However, in the US (I can't really talk about other countries) there is explicit talk and education about what murder and theft are, and why they are wrong.  There is not open discussion about rape, however.  Feminists want consent to be a more active discussion in sex education (which is slowly happening) because a surprising amount of people don't know what rape is.  

A good example is actually in the movie 16 Candles.  Jake sees that his girlfriend is incredibly intoxicated, but lets a random guy take her and says ""be my guest"" in reference to having his way with her.  There is another 80's movie that has a scene like this, but I can't remember the name.  Anyways, around that time that was something that was deemed funny and light-hearted because our culture, at the time, thought that was okay.  That is rape culture.  If it weren't for people speaking out about it, people would still think that having sex with an unconscious person was okay. 

People tend to attack feminists for talking about things by saying ""why not talk about this?""  That's because feminists can talk about everything.  It's a philosophy that focuses on equal rights for women, and that's okay.  There are groups that focus on equal rights for people of other races, sexuality, gender, etc.  "	cl8d37v	t1_cl7vdg2	radams713	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"The *16 Candles* example is a good one. And don't get me wrong, there is nothing I would like more than to see the conversation about sexual assault expand, sex education to cover it, and for people to stop demonizing the word feminism- I've just had a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of rape culture. 

If we compare the reaction to an anti-rape invention, like the drug detecting nail polish, to an anti-theft invention, like the bike lock, why is only one an indicator that a culture implicitly condones the action it tries to prevent?

"One thing to think about (when comparing rape and murder) would be that rape leaves a survivor behind. Obviously murder is a heinous crime but unlike rape the victim of it isn't around afterwards to answer to everyone why/how they provoked their murderer or how they should've behaved differently so as not to get murdered.

And as for theft, obviously it's horrible too but I imagine in many cases it doesn't leave the victim (and their family) scarred like rape or dead like murder. Because the weight of the crime is different it doesn't feel as victim-blamey to give advice on how not to let it happen again.

That being said, I think it's smart to try not to put yourself in situations where any of those could happen but it can also just be impossible to judge what those situations are...which is why asking those ""well did you...?"" feels like putting the responsibility on the victim which shouldn't be done. They already have to deal with the emotional trauma of whatever happened. They may even be coming up with the things other people say ""I shouldn't have...if only I hadn't..."" so they don't need someone telling them and making them feel worse."	cl7zw2b	t1_cl7vdg2	Snophie	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Hmmm... clearly I have not taken the time to fully flesh out my opinion. My gut reaction is that psychologically damaging someone is generally worse than physically damaging them (assuming that the physical damage does not result in psychological trauma.)

To be entirely honest, my abhorrence of rape is likely an entirely visceral reaction with very little basis in logic. I don't think I'm the only person in the world that feels this way, though it seems like I'm the only one ITT.

"After giving it some more thought, I've discovered that my opinion stems from this:

Killing is not black and white. There are circumstances under which it is an acceptable option (i.e. self defense.) There are no circumstances under which rape is acceptable. As such, I find rape to be a ""worse"" crime.

Also, I think most people are evaluating these two crimes from a perspective of wasted potential (a life cut short is more tragic than a traumatized life.) I am viewing it from the perspective of suffering caused, and from that perspective, the greater harm is done to the rape survivor.

Just because I view one thing as worse than the other does not mean that the other thing is suddenly a solution to the first. As the old saying goes, two wrongs don't make a right.

"Thank you for your well considered reply. :)

&gt; Killing is not black and white. There are circumstances under which it is an acceptable option (i.e. self defense.) There are no circumstances under which rape is acceptable. As such, I find rape to be a ""worse"" crime.

I find this distinction to be misleading. ""Killing"" has a very different boundary condition from ""Rape"" due to the objectively measurable difference it causes in the environment. As such, it is trivial to consider mitigating examples and illustrations of it.

""Murder"" on the other hand is basically just *defined* as ""illegal/immoral/unjustifiable killing"".

Rape shares with Murder the concept of ""it has to be unjustifiable to qualify"". Any ER surgeon operating on a patient who was unconscious on arrival would in fact be penetrating their body without pre-arranged consent, but we don't call this ""rape"" explicitly *because* it is justifiable.

&gt; I am viewing it from the perspective of suffering caused, and from that perspective, the greater harm is done to the rape survivor.

I do not agree with this measurement, though. The person who bears direct impact (rape survivor, murder victim) is not the only victim and not the only person who suffers. Their friends, family, employers, community all suffer with them to varying degrees. I would gather that everyone in the community together suffers less when a loved one survives a trauma than when their loved one is lost forever.

I can give this some perspective, to boot. I am a rape survivor. Had I instead been a murder victim, I expect that it would have lead to an immensely larger helping of suffering for everybody who cares about me, so I am glad to be alive today for sure. :("	cl8zxq6	t1_cl8cnm2	jesset77	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

The problem with this sentiment is that if you argue the effects of rape (which I grant are numerous and incredibly painful) are worst than the effects of murder, which is death, than you're claiming that suicide is the best option for rape victims, because you're literally making the case that what happened to them is worse than death.

"In other news, whether I agree with you today or not, and whether I will agree with you tomorrow or not, I would like to go on record as greatly respecting your candor to admit when your position is presently unprepared for a certain rebuttal instead of throwing mud or making up red herrings as I've seen so many others do.

I enjoy respectful debates, and a position neither has to be incorrect (nor has to be without value even if it later gets conceded) just because of being insufficiently considered on one or more faces at a certain time.

"&gt; Murder affects the victim once. A rape can continue to affect the victim for the rest of his/her/their life.

That's because someone who gets murdered doesn't have a life to experience anything through anymore.  This suggests that rape victims will never experience anything worth living for after getting raped.  And someone's death can continue to affect people who knew them.

"No, rape survivors can still have a lot of good in their lives after that experience, but they may also have to relive it hundreds of times in their lifetime.

My only argument here is that one instance of suffering is less abhorrent than repeated, prolonged suffering, even if the repeated suffering is accompanied by more opportunity to experience good.

Basically, I'm quibbling over /u/WattersonBill 's assumption that murder is more or less universally considered to be a worse crime than rape, as there are those who would disagree.

My reply to /u/bpj1805 here ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j196u/cmv_that_rape_culture_does_not_exist_in_a/cl82api)) is also a response to your post.

After you read that, the below is more specific to your points.



&gt;""He deserved to get assaulted and robbed... ...3am while singing loudly.""
&gt;
&gt;""She deserved to get raped... ...3am while singing loudly.""
&gt;
&gt;They ""should"" expect it, though.
&gt;
&gt;Granted, those scenarios are heavily exaggerated to prove my point.


The problem with this kind of comparison is that protecting yourself from robbery and protecting yourself from rape aren't just different animals, they're different planets.

1. On the street
2. In an alley
3. Through intimidation

4. Are alone or with just a few friends.

Your attacker is ____:

1. A stranger

3. At your friend's house
4. At your house
5. At a party
6. At a date's house

3. A co-worker
4. An ex-boyfriend/girlfriend
5. A current boyfriend/girlfriend
6. A police officer
7. A blind date
8. A town hero


You understand the problem here. It doesn't help that 90% of assaults are committed by people known to the victim. When should you ""expect"" rape? All the time forever?

"You can leave the photo up, I don't mind.

&gt; Your car analogy is insufficient because you're not always driving. You don't ever have to drive if you really don't want to.

Fair enough, but most people continue to drive while tens of thousands of Americans die in motor vehicle accidents annually.  Some people need to drive in order to make a living.  And exceedingly drastic measures can be taken to avoid murder too, like living as a hermit.

Although drawing parallels between the paranoia that may stem from rape, robbery, murder, or even driving isn't entirely practical, I'm focusing on the same point as you:

"I don't think any of your three bulleted points actually add evidence to the full-fledged existence of a ""culture"" of rape whatsoever. 

I doubt your first point would play out as outlined...in fact I think the scenario would basically occur exactly counter to that. Imagine the blog posts and Op-Eds.

Your second point makes a huge leap in tying conversation (flirting) to the physical act of rape. The connection there is really lacking. Almost everybody understands the difference between flirting (a conversational act that occurs with words) and raping.   

Your third point doesn't really further your argument. Anytime you're violating consent, that's rape. It would be very hard to violate consent and not realize that is what you are doing. I'm sure many rapists don't criticize their actions deeply enough, so I would agree somewhat there, but it really says nothing about an entire culture. 

A culture implies community or communal beliefs. There are no areas in the United States that think rape is a positive thing whatsoever last time I checked. Rape is considered one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. Look at how prisoner's view rapists...the general public agrees, short of murder, it's one of the worst possible things to do to another human being. 

Maybe it's a naming problem? I would say there are bad ideas that are maybe ""rape-enabling"", but I can't help think ""rape culture"" is a valid way to describe such ideas, as the word culture seems to point the finger at some non-existent community...hence why whenever ""rape culture"" is brought up, it's met with resistance because it violates the experiences of almost every individual that has lived and grown to abhor rape. 

""Rape culture"" makes it sound like there is a secret club of people located in every town that meets every Wednesday to advocate for rape. The word is cartoonish. Call ideas that are promotional of rape something else and I don't think there would be much disagreement.

"I have a serious problem with this explanation.

&gt;It's about a culture that says it abhors it, while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault.

Compared to what other culture? Have there been studies about other cultures that have existed throughout history, concerning rape statistics? Does this particular First Western World Culture have higher rape statistics than the rest? If not, why is only this called a rape culture? Or is every culture so far called a 'rape culture'?

Has the revision culture suggested by feminism even been tested anywhere? Or are we taking it at some peoples' word without checking if it's any better?

[Remember, there have been similar rhetorics about violence in male-dominated cultures, but it has been indicated that violence follows humanity as a whole, not just men.](http://io9.com/societies-where-women-outnumber-men-are-just-as-violent-1644594750?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_facebook&amp;utm_source=io9_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow).

"Quite frankly, I don't care whether it ""feels"" to you like those are the exception. If you want to determine what is the exception rather than the rule, you need to talk to victims of rape and actually understand the experiences they go through when they try to a) figure out if they actually want to tell the police, b) determine if they'll actually be taken seriously by the police if they do, c) figure out whether they want to challenge the reputation of the rapist, especially if that person is high-profile or someone the victim cares about, and d) figure out what their friends, family, and others will say if they decide to tell others.

"&gt;Just because you don't personally experience people saying ""she deserves it"", that doesn't mean that it is the exception when it comes to actual victims of rape.

Even if victims universally and exclusively receive negative support for their experience, it doesn't mean we have a rape culture. What it does mean is that there are shitty people in this world, who may be self-selecting themselves into that victim's life. The fact that *those* shitty people are shitty does not necessarily imply that we have a rape *culture*. More like a rape subculture, composed of all those shitty people.

&gt;Quite frankly, I don't care whether it ""feels"" to you like those are the exception. If you want to determine what is the exception rather than the rule, you need to talk to victims of rape and actually understand the experiences they go through

"&gt;Despite strong explicit views about rape, when high-profile cases of rape occur, sometimes individuals are quick to excuse the rapists for other reasons (e.g., celebrity status; sporting achievements; academic tenure; notions of the victim ""deserving it"" because of clothing choices, intoxication, or past sexual promiscuity).

i'm tired of people lying about the voice of society regarding rape. the idea that ""we"" say the victim ""deserves it"" is completely untrue. 99.9% of us would never say that. i literally have never heard anyone say that. 

just because a couple of twitter trolls and some guy on Fox News said it once doesn't mean that ""society"" thinks that. why do you think there is outrage whenever someone says something like that?

people have got to stop saying what ""society"" says about this sort of thing, they don't know what ""society"" says, and it's obvious.

"&gt; It's about a culture that says it abhors it, while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault.

So just to be clear, any culture which has above 0% incidence of rape is a rape culture? Or is it just stigmatized for anybody to disagree with you in particular about which direction to take to remedy the problem?

This country spends hundreds of millions every year prosecuting cases and passing laws and refining judgments on these matters with the result of a rising population seeing a drop every year out of the last 30 in per-capita rape incidence but *you* fail to see the narrow changes *you* feel would be best, thus you label the entire culture as diseased?

&gt; in books about how to teach your children about sex, teaching them about the importance of consent is often not a strong priority.

Quite the contrary: in almost all books teaching children about sex *abstinence and celibacy* are advocated as the only safe means of living your life and following *that* advice (successfully) would certainly insulate any person from committing rape as well.

&gt; Strong cultural norms regarding relationships and sex teach women to play ""hard to get"" (i.e., say ""no"" when they mean ""yes""), and teach men to ignore initial negative responses to persuade women to say ""yes"". As a source, watch virtually any romance movie ever.

Aside from trying to source cultural expectations from out of fiction, who does this consent-disrespecting stereotype you talk about even serve? How many men *want* women to lie about their intentions? Compare this with how many women are perfectly satisfied to misrepresent their intentions for selfish purposes. ""I told him no when I meant yes because I wanted him to demonstrate the manly way he could melt my objections"" or ""I told him yes when I meant no because zomg I was afraid for my life and he's so creepy and I had to buy time to get out of there!""

In my view, the biggest root of unhealthy sexual expectations in our culture today is the infantilization of women, and the expectation that they should never be left to live up to whatever negative consequences their choices might lead to — the same way that men universally are.

For example, the expectation that whoever initiates sexual intimacy takes on 100% responsibility for how everybody feels the next morning, that any regret at this phase renders the initiator as indistinguishable from Jeffrey Dahmer, and of course that said tension only has meaning when the initiator is male because to this day not a sole will take female initiation seriously or ever feel brave enough to try to assign blame in such a direction.

The only thing rape-hysteria does is trivialize rape, and *that* is the primary problem we face today. You cannot even *have* a meaningful discussion about consent if both parties fail to share the responsibility of communicating  and negotiating it."	cl84ji0	t1_cl7nh5y	jesset77	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;Despite a strong intolerance for rape, the notion of active consent is rarely an active discussion topic

Would be that because having to be a veritable cheerleader during an intimate act takes away from the intimacy of the act?

Could it be that having a standard of infinite work in confirming something is unreasonable?

&gt;Despite strong explicit views about rape, when high-profile cases of rape occur, sometimes individuals are quick to excuse the rapists for other reasons (e.g., celebrity status; sporting achievements; academic tenure; notions of the victim ""deserving it"" because of clothing choices, intoxication, or past sexual promiscuity).

There is a difference between ""that was a bad decision"" and ""they're not actually a victim due to making a bad decision""

&gt;Strong cultural norms regarding relationships and sex teach women to play ""hard to get"" (i.e., say ""no"" when they mean ""yes""), and teach men to ignore initial negative responses to persuade women to say ""yes"". As a source, watch virtually any romance movie ever.

That's an issue of ambiguity. There is a difference between actually being hard to get and playing it.

&gt;It's about a culture that says it abhors it, while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault.

That's essentially a cop out. It's basically saying ""rape exists so society hasn't done enough to get rid of it, so the culture must be the sole reason it exists""

This same kind of logic not only ignores that some people don't actually care what other people think and will act anyways(meaning culture was not the reason they acted), but also applies to every transgression ever, meaning we have a theft culture, a speeding culture, and a hurt feelings culture."	cl8ayu7	t1_cl7nh5y	TracyMorganFreeman	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I don't think I'm answering your question but here goes. My own personal problem with 'rape culture' is that we spend so much time warning victims against the wrong people. The media paints rapists as ninjas that hide in dark alleys and pounce on the drunk and scantily dressed. (OK, *slight* exaggeration.) [In reality, the majority of rape is committed by someone known to the victim in a more familiar setting.](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders)

I wish we would put more energy into helping people identify problematic relationships. I'm more likely to be raped by a friend or boyfriend than some random dude in a bar. Especially considering that I don't go to bars.

Unless I missed it, you have neglected to mention the experiences of male victims of rape. Maybe you're considering them as a separate issue? Either way, they may be the most affected by rape culture. Sure, we have legal penalties for rapists but that doesn't mean shit when the victim is literally laughed out of the police station because they 'must have enjoyed it'."	cl7gb7g	t3_2j196u	uuuummm	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I've taken the time to look at the scientific literature on the subject as it piqued my interest roughly a year ago. From the analysis, that I will site below, there is one major influencing factor, even when other variables were controlled, had a *very* strong correlation: liquor. There were some other, minor, factors such as: Smoking, dress, age, attractiveness, and so on. But none of these came close as liquor did. In fact you could actually make a program that accounted for liquor consumption and shot out the probability of sexual-assault to a high degree of certainty. 

--

Among the cases examined probability of sexual assault - distinguished from rape because it includes a number of other actions - from 14-25. The studies found a spike around the freshmen year of college and a high correlation to liquor consumption with the age of the assailant being roughly 22.

--

This paints a statistical picture, one that quite interestingly runs along stereotypical lines: A college-aged freshmen female, out *binge drinking* (separated out from being drunk, or casual use of alcohol in that cases examined showed people who routinely got *very drunk* at a high frequency), and then had non-consensual sexual relations with a 22 year old male, who was usually also drunk.

--

So it isn't as simple as you thought and there is a reason the experts make the recommendations they do. Only a small sample was of the case you described. 

--

In closing: **If you want to minimize the variables you control for and in effect minimize your risk do not binge drink routinely.** Smaller factors such as, as laid-out above, include: Smoking, attractiveness, clothing, and body language - but none of these factors held a candle to binge drinking.

"&gt; People should be able to go to a kegger and NOT be afraid of getting raped.


I don't think anyone disagreed.

This is going to sound harsh, but, crime happens. You could equally argue from your premise statements like:

&gt; *We shouldn't have to lock our doors! Robbery should never happen!*

--

Again, no one is disagreeing with you and we should work to solve *all* societal problems. From the *evidence* I've seen on the matter sexual crimes drop off precipitously after legalizing prostitution; that seems like a far more rational solution than yelling about how it should never happen. 

--

&gt; It's the acceptance of ""Well, rape will happen if you make certain choices.""

**NO IT IS NOT.** *Do not* twist my language, I will not have that. What I said it from the *evidence* sexual assault is far more likely when people, of any gender, binge drink consistency and heavily. You can *choose* to do something, or not. At the end of the day *no-one* is forcing anyone to, nor is anyone saying if you are sexually assaulted it is your fault. 

&gt; Rape should never happen and never be excused for or EXPECTED in any circumstance. - _ - that's why I believe rape culture is a problem.

Last I checked we render harsh sentences (harsher on men, compared to women; worth noting more men than women are raped, by far, when you include prison rape) against rapists. **NO ONE** condones sexual crimes.

I have never heard anyone say any of those things in respect to a rape victim.

Really? Watch any number of Fox News reports on things like rape, what a woman should be wearing, and how a woman should respond to things like affection. I think you live in a very sad bubble that you're insistent upon pushing on others. There's a reason that feminism is wildyly popular with women (Which I think is silly, for starters, that it's not MORE popular with men who suffer THE SAME from negative sexist gender roles as women). I know people IN MY OWN LIFE that have EXPLICITLY taken advantage of people too drunk to consent. I know people that have JUSTIFIED the same behavior. Your anecdotes, you soon realize, are not representative. So what I have to go with is the fact that modern feminism IS wildly popular because these issues are issues that women face DAILY. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hC0Ng_ajpY doesn't have 4 million views because it's fringe and extreme. It's because it's REPRESENTATIVE of things people have to deal with (again, NOT JUST WOMEN).	cl816mh	t1_cl80u1x	macinneb	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely.

Faux news I think most intelligent people think they are idiots for the most part.  Why is it that i live in a sad bubble when you are the one who apparently have people in your life that have taken advantage of others?  I guess the people that I hang out with are the variety that ya know take care of each other, not advantage of each other.  Again not saying it doesn't happen, just saying it isn't the norm.  Like I said earlier I'm not against feminism just the dumb tumblr/SJW variety.  Pardon me if I base my belief structure off things like facts.  Lastly if you want to know why men shy away from feminism look no further than the SJW's on Tumblr (the vocal minority i would guess). 	cl81qcv	t1_cl816mh	muckit	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; This analysis in itself is sort of a good example of what people mean by rape culture.

This analysis? Well, if you have a contention with the sources I provided or the work they've done I'm sure you can contest them; but that is not my opinion, it is the conclusion of numerous studies. 


&gt; It focuses on what the victim can do differently, which in our society it is almost always about what the victim should do differently. Don't drink, dress modestly, etc. The crux of rape culture is this kind of *victim blaming.*

[Italics added]

I a way I understand your protest, I really do. That said I beg to differ, and heres why: I am *not* victim blaming. Not once did I say someone deserved any outcome and would equally blame the aggressor over the victim in all circumstances; this much largely goes unsaid. What I am saying is *there are variables within your control.* Instead of tepidly cowering in reproach I prefer to both empower myself, but more importantly empower my sister, my female friends, and girlfriends with actionable advice. 


--

But I really do understand what you're saying; in that we do often focus on risk-mitigation strategies after the fact. I of course advocate for counseling as well, but that is somewhat besides the point here. I would pose to you one question; do you know why 'we' focus on what can be done to prevent rape? Because maybe someone will take that advice, maybe that will prevent them from falling prey to a disgusting piece of vile. Further, the assailant is in jail, how, or why, should we focus on the aggressor? Wouldn't you rather prevent a crime?

--

For example: There is a difference between taking steps to prevent a crime from happening and who is at fault for that crime happening. 



&gt; taking advantage of a drunk person is wrong (yes there really are lots of people out there with the attitude that if you're drunk you deserve it) and how to have personal boundaries regardless of how someone is dressed, etc etc.


On this you and I are in agreement, largely at least. Among those polled - referring to the studies above - a large portion of polled participants thought their actions were, well, not justified, but they didn't consider themselves 'rapists' - although the distinction is somewhat cloudy as the studies addressed more than just penetrative sex. But again I don't think this is as simple as 'teach people not to rape' or 'teach people what consent means' as the overlap between those that need to hear that message, and those that are sociopaths is near 100%.

"&gt; That is what a Rape looks like.

It's not the *only* way the rape looks like, however.

Considering about two-thirds of rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, you simply cannot write off other scenarios.

What you describe is rape, but so is a situation when...

*a guy finds a blacked out girl lying on a bed at the party and thinks she's a fair game;

someone who considers themselves ""friendzoned"" and assumes that she was ""leading him on"" so long, that she simply has to know, why he really invited her for a night long movie marathon to his apartment;

an ex-boyfriend who concludes that, if they had sex a 100 times, she can't *really* be so much against the 101, last time now, when there's an occasion, even though it was her who broke up with him;

A co-worker or a boss, who thinks that if she's always always very friendly and enthusiastically agrees to stay for the night shift, where there will be just the two of them, she's basically giving consent right there;

finally a husband, who thinks that she has given an infinite consent, when she said ""yes"" at the altar;

If you reject these types of events and refuse to call them rape, than problem is on your side and your side only. The fact you yourself feel ""threatened"" stems from your definition being too narrow and your unwillingness to accept the facts. Not some witch hunt.

*In all the examples I use man as the aggressor and the woman as a victim, but obviously this is not the only possible combination."	cl7lo4q	t1_cl7ir2n	Kac3rz	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;Everyday, as a male I am always threatened by organizations such as RAINN for being the monster that attacked my mother. Feminism has been used to target the innocent because it is incapable of stopping the guilty.

I'd like you to elaborate on this. Do you feel threatened by the expanded definition of rape? (Genuinely asking.)

&gt;That is what a Rape looks like.

How can you say that? There are so many different types of rape... say I'm dating a guy. We've had sex in the past. One night, he wants to but I say no. He holds me down and does the deed anyway. That's rape, and if I'm expected to put up with that shit, I'd rather stay single. You know who asks permission? Netflix.

And that was the tamest example I could think of.

&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28939089[1]

&gt;Even today, Stockholm is one of the most dangerous cities for women, but ""Feminism"" is about stopping """"""Rape Culture"""""" instead of stopping actual Rape.

OK I read through the whole article. Maybe I missed something, I suck at reading. I still don't see how you concluded that ""Rape Culture"" had any affect on this case.

More importantly, can't we try to stop rape AND rape culture? Being raped is terrible.

"OK I think we're arguing a whole lot of different things at once and it's confusing the hell out of me. I'm not too bright, OK? Slow down.

Tell me if I have this wrong, but your issue with rape culture is:

* Women can accuse innocent men of rape and be believed
* We're ignoring hundreds of children being raped and instead focusing on 'rape culture' 
* Feminism is turning into Misandry which will hurt our cause and further divide men and women

In regards to your first point, yeah, that happens and it sucks. A man can be accused of rape and his whole life is ruined. A woman or man can claim to have been raped and be completely ignored. These are BOTH problems, one does not cancel out the other. We need to completely rethink our approach to cases of rape.

I honestly have no idea how to approach your second point. Here in my country, there's been a massive royal commission into institutionalised child abuse. It's all over the news. It's certainly overtaken any discussions of feminism. The idea that ongoing child abuse is the fault of feminists for not stopping it is beyond my comprehension. Should I blame the prison rape epidemic on Men's Rights Activists for not having stopped it by now? That makes no sense.

As for Misandry, I agree that too many discussions devolve into 'men vs women' which is terrible. However, this happens on both sides. Providing that 'men's tears' picture isn't helping, mate. I don't lump /r/TheRedPill in with mainstream MRA's so it would be nice if you didn't confuse the shit you'd see on /r/TumblrInAction with mainstream feminism.

As far as I can tell, we both agree on a lot of things. It's labels such as 'man,' 'woman,' and 'feminism' that divide us. I agree with a lot of feminist stances. I agree with a lot of MRA ones too. Judging by your post, so do you. We both see the example of rape culture that you linked as a problem, right? We both agree that the man-hating strand of feminism will only turn men away. I am a feminist (I think?), you are a man, and we agree. I think framing this argument as 'men vs feminism' is the real problem. Painting half of the population with the same brush will get us no where. Our society holds sexist values against men AND women. These values are held by men and women. We have to fight these values, not each other.

I'm not even bringing video games into a discussion on actual rape. I play video games to shoot people and raise monsters to do my bidding.

"Thank you for your perspective. For the reasons you outline, I often find it difficult to identify as a feminist. For those same reasons I don't like arguing against feminism either, because it is made up of so many different ideologies now. I agree with some and disagree with others. What am I?

I need somebody to change my view that a man would have to enjoy it to have penetrative sex with a woman. I can believe in men raping men, I can believe in women forcing themselves on men. What I can't understand is how I could get an erection while being forced into sex by someone. Maybe if there was a gun involved and I had incentive to try, but I just don't see it. 	cl7qmbn	t1_cl7gb7g	pandemic1444	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

It's an involuntary physiological response.   You've never heard of an unwanted erection?   It's similar to how female rape victims can sometimes experience orgasms during rape.

Sex is part mental, and part physical. Just because your mind isn't into it doesn't mean you cannot have random erections in public. And on top of that, with actual physical stimulation, it can definitely happen. It's roughly analogous to women coming to orgasm in rape. Just because your mind rejects what it is experiencing doesn't mean that certain automatic reactions to stimuli are shut off.	cl7r1v0	t1_cl7qmbn	WhamBamMaam	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I can attempt to answer this by relating it back to women, which seems backwards and I'm sorry if it doesn't help. 

My aunt used to be a rape and crisis counselor. She said that the majority of girls actually had an orgasm, and almost all of them were turned on at some point. This doesn't mean that any of them weren't raped. The vagina doesn't care if your mind consents, the vagina just knows it's being simulated. 

I imagine the same goes for penises. The penis doesn't care if it's being raped, it just knows that it's being simulated. 

One final note, many male victims were drugged with viagra and the like, or they had consented to activities that would induce an erection but not sex. For example, a man likely gets hard when he makes out with someone, but that doesn't mean it's not rape if he's coerced or forced into sex.

"Yeah, that's why states like California have started to change the definition of rape. I know there's lots of complaints about ""IF SHE DOESN'T SAY YES EXPLICITLY AND SIGN A WRITTEN CONTRACT THAT SHE'S OKAY WITH THE SEX, IT'S RAPE"" that's coming from the rabid radfems, but the current definition in most states isn't sufficient anymore. It's rape if you don't consent, and the purpose of rape culture at it's core is fighting the idea that a lack of no means consent."	cl7ypgg	t1_cl7w4zu	captainwednesday	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I know this post is kinda old but I haven't seen OP give a delta so I'll approach this from a different angle. I was under your POV until I had someone explain it this way to me.

Imagine a rape. Think of the most stereotypical rape you can think of. What is it? Its probably a shady looking dude waiting in an alley at night, jumping out and snatching up a woman walking by herself and pulling her in right? Or is it the guy hanging at the bar with a bag of mollys, slipping them in unattended drinks? Both of these situations happen, no doubt, but they aren't close to the majority. The majority of non-prison rapes are by people the victim knows in a familiar bedroom. 

Why do we think of the other examples when asked about rape? Because thats how its portrayed on TV and in movies. This isn't an inherently bad thing. TV shows don't have the time usually to explain that a situation is rape so they throw up the stereotypical rapist so that the audience knows whats going on. The problem is that this becomes what everyone's idea of what a rape is. A guy will pick up a blacking out drunk girl at a party, take her upstairs and have sex with her because he'll think he's doing nothing wrong. ""I didn't drug her, I didn't snatch her up from an alley,"" he'll think, ""I'm not some creepy weirdo, I'm not a rapist like the ones on TV, she just had too much to drink! She should watch out more! Its her fault!"" This is where the whole ""teaching people not to rape thing"" comes into play. Nobody's trying to tell the creepy guys in the alley that what they're doing is wrong, they're telling people in the above example that what they did is not okay and they should think twice. 

And this goes both ways, it's not solely a women's issue. Almost a majority (if not, a majority) of rapes are male on male prison rapes in this country. But instead of trying to combat it, we just don't care. We joke about it. ""Don't drop the soap lol"" is a common one. We act as if going to prison just means that you will inevitably be raped and we just have to accept that. Idk about you, thats kinda fucked up. I know prison's a bad place but I don't like the idea of the gov't having institutions of rape that we just accept. 

I completely understand where you're coming from in your OP. I used to think that too. ""wtf, people hate rapists. celebrity rape scandals are always national news, who is advocating for this?"" "" 'teach people not to rape'? what does that mean? might as well tell people not to steal"".
The problem isn't that we're excusing the predators in alleys, its that we're excusing the blurry lines. The situations where ""I didn't see that on TV as a rape so I don't think its one"" or ""she was so drunk she just shouldn't drink that much she said she liked me before she started drinking"" that we overlook which are a problem. And before its brought up, I most definitely think the genders can be reversed. A woman can definitely take advantage of a man who had too much to drink, was being flirty beforehand etc. 

I feel like I formatted that weird so I'm sorry if it was tough to read"	cl7ms21	t3_2j196u	Panzer6	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Hi, Panzer, a majority of rapes in the country are not prison rapes.  However, perhaps (and I am *not* certain here), prison rapes account for the highest incidence rate (i.e., rapes per capita).

"I don't think this is so much of a problem anymore. Saying no to a drunk girl because she is drunk pops up in movies and on TV quite regularly these days. Just to give examples the most recent I recall seeing are Superbad and The Inbetweeners. In both cases the male protagonist is lead to a bedroom by a very drunk girl that they have a crush on, and the male expresses that he would really like to but won't because it doesn't feel right with the girl being so drunk.

I think this scenario pops up regularly enough in teen movies. It's possible not enough emphasis is put on the fact that if they have sex in that scenario it is rape, but it doesn't change the fact that modern media definitely portrays having sex under those conditions as wrong. I feel that anyone who has sex where the other person is clearly very drunk (assuming they themselves are not so drunk they can't tell) knows what they are doing is wrong, just as much as the man in the bushes knows what he is doing is wrong."	cl84j43	t1_cl7ms21	tiddlypeeps	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;First of all, sexual assault is punished severely...

 Sexual assault is punished severely, but only *when it is successfully prosecuted.*  Because rape is a ""private crime,"" it is very difficult to prove. Criminal prosecutors are unlikely to even try a case unless they think it has a chance of being successful, and cases are only likely to be successful if they are pretty obvious.  This leads to under-prosecution on top of the already well-known under-reporting of non-violent rapes (i.e., in cases where there is not much physical evidence, such as where the victim said no, but was too scared or too incapacitated to fight back.)

&gt;Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable...

  Your analogy is very fair, but I will take it in the opposite direction, and I'll give you an example.  I myself was mugged once.  I was alone in a dark alley right next to my on-campus apartment building, about to get into my car, when a guy came up from behind and yelled at me to give him my wallet. When I reported it, the campus police asked me why I had been in an alley by myself, and I was angry.  It was pretty easy for the guy *not to* mug me, but the only other place to park was across campus in a sketchy, expensive garage. Sure, perhaps there were other precautions I could have taken, but that should not draw attention from the fact that the only other person involved in the situation had committed a crime.  It is one thing to warn, another to blame. Victim blaming (in the form of, ""well, you were basically asking for it) is inappropriate for either thievery or rape, and I may even go as far to say that it is evidence of a ""crime culture"" in our society and others.  As a side note, OP, during the time I was getting mugged, I thought of two things: (1) ""God, I have, like, two presentations and an exam tomorrow, and I really don't have time for this,"" and (2) ""Please please please don't try to rape me; it is so cold tonight.""  This guy probably didn't even wonder whether I would be worried about that, but I guarantee that nearly every female mugging victim would think about it.

  Now, I will try to go into what I think may be some unspoken views.  There is a misconception that rape is a crime of violence.  It isn't, although violence is taken into account for degrees of rape.  It is a **crime of violation of autonomy,** specifically, sexual autonomy.  Until the late 20th century, laws required that for a person to be raped (1) it had to be vaginal, (2) it had to be forced, which meant that the victim had to ""resist to the utmost,"" or her assailant had to incapacitate her in some way such that she could not fight back, and (3) the rapist could not be the husband of the victim - wives had a duty to have sex with their husbands, and any violent action taken against her was a different crime (**note** that I used only feminine pronouns here for now, more on that below).  Laws have changed drastically; for example, now, instead of force, consent is the major factor in determining whether a rape has occurred - if he/she did not consent, then it was rape.  However, in practice, consent does not mean saying yes, but not saying no.  If he/she did not say no, did he/she consent?  Many laws, and most courts, require that he/she give an affirmative no for the act to be considered a rape, where only a couple of states only require the victim to show that he/she did not yes. Also, the marital exemption is gone in about half of states, but most of the other half have merely qualified the marital exemption - it's less of a punishment to rape your own spouse.  

 Further, one should not make the mistake of thinking that ""rape culture"" is a feminist view. Although women are about 5x more likely to be raped than men, men are more likely than women not to report a rape because they fear (1) not being believed, (2) criticism for not being able to defend himself against another (whether woman or man), and/or (3) criticism for ""not wanting it,"" because there is a mentality in our culture that men should want sex whenever they can get it (note that most male-victim rapes occur in prisons).  For these same reasons, it is often much harder for men to find support in dealing with such trauma.  Finally, those laws I mentioned earlier only recognized rape as forced vaginal intercourse - legally, men could not be raped!  Laws have made great steps in ensuring that men are able to get justice for violations of sexual autonomy as well.  However, although the laws have made some progress, this does not mean that their enforcement necessarily has: it does not mean that police officers are arresting rapists; it does not mean that prosecutors are trying rapists; finally, it does not mean that juries are delivering justice.

  Rape culture undoubtedly exists, and it is wrong to think that men are the only people who perpetuate the culture.  Women do too. Think *50 Shades of Grey*, where it is apparently romantic for a man to ignore the safe word during S&amp;M, or where she says no when he goes to take off her smelly shoes, but he has sex with her anyway, warning her that he will tie her up if she resists.  Think *Blurred Lines*, number one song on multiple charts in 2013, where the chorus repeats that he's ""gon' take a good girl"" despite the ambiguity in whether she wants him or not, because she's wearing those jeans and it's in her nature. Think of *Twilight*, where apparently is okay for a guy to sneak in a girls' bedroom to watch her sleep, to use his vampirey nature mesmerize her into wanting him to the point of suicide.  Think of the guy at work who tells his fellow male coworkers that he would ""tear up that ass,"" speaking of a colleague who wore an outfit that outlined her curves. Think of the movie *Obsessed*, where the issue was that the woman stalked the husband, but the fact that she clearly raped him and later attempted to rape him was never really explored in the movie. Think of the movie ""That's my Boy,"" which glorifies the 13-y.o. boy who had sex with his teacher (to be fair though, she *is* sentenced for statutory rape in the movie).  Rape culture is not the culture that people condone violent rape, but where people excuse rape in certain circumstances, or feel that the victim is partly to blame for whatever reason, or that the perpetrator should not be punished because of some extenuating circumstance (young and stupid, drunk, she was dressed skimpily, she didn't say no, etc.).  These examples show the presence of the view that rape may be okay, even praised, in certain contexts.

  Is it rape if he/she didn't say no even though he/she didn't want it? Does he/she need to say yes for it not to be rape? After all, if he/she doesn't want it, shouldn't he/she have a natural instinct to at least say no?   If not, how affirmative must her actions be before it isn't rape?  Just not saying no?  Should a person be punished for reasonably misunderstanding the victim's signals? From whose perspective should we measure what is reasonable? If not, what do we do for a victim who is traumatized by the experience?  Is it rape if a boyfriend has sex with his girlfriend (genders reversible) while she sleeps (she never said yes, but has she affirmed it by having sex with him before, or by calling him her boyfriend)?  Is it rape if the victim consented, but only because they were subject to extortion (maybe varying degrees here: ""I'll give you the promotion, but only if you have sex with me"" vs. ""I'll only let you graduate if you have sex with me"").  Should it be considered rape if it is achieved through deception (Barney Stinson...)?  These are controversial questions, and I don't pretend to think that my answers are the only answers, or even the right answers. (If you're curious, I can give you my answers, but I think that that is outside the scope of your views).  Rape culture exists because there are extremely different views about what these answers should be, and the views are shifting.  That is what creates culture - views on the way life is meant to operate.

I've left out specific statistics because (1) I didn't feel like it because they are easy to look up if you are curious, and (2) I didn't think that they'd actually make too much a difference.""  Some of the example I've given are very specific - that is because I used my Criminal Law book to look up some of these issues.  Also, I apologize for typos; I didn't mean for this to be a freakin' essay when I started, and I don't really want to proofread.

**TL;DR**: (1) Sexual assault is under-reported and under-prosecuted, and therefore under-punished; (2) I disagree that victim-blaming is okay in other contexts, so it is difficult for me to answer this point; (3) Rape is a crime of the violation of sexual autonomy, not a crime of violence (even though such may be used); (4) a bit of legal history - laws regarding rape have taken great steps in preventing the culture, but they are not always successful in practice; (6) rape culture is not a ""feminist view"" - both genders are affected by rape culture, but generally in different ways (5) examples of rape culture; (6) questions for consideration; (7) sorry for typos.

**Edit**: OP, I recently reread both your submission and my response, and I am wondering whether you have a definition of what you think ""rape culture"" is.  You say that people don't condone rape, but many may feel that ""rape"" is still mis-defined (remember, it used to be defined as forced vaginal intercourse by non-husbands only).  To ignore this point is to misunderstand what someone means by ""rape culture.""  This is but one point raised in my response, but I wanted to clarify it.  Also, even if you do not agree that there is a majority rape culture, sub-cultures and anti-societies exist that represent the ""rape culture"" (see /r/rapingwomen [rape victims please do not go to that subreddit if you are prone to triggers])"	cl7x31p	t3_2j196u	Reborn33	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I'm picking you since you have the most comprehensive and reasonable reply. 
&gt;I am wondering whether you have a definition of what you think ""rape culture"" is.

Several posters have said something to this effect, but none of you have offered a definition for 'rape culture'. You've referenced movies and songs that seem on one level or another to perhaps condone rape, but I'm looking for a definition or summation, if you could.

"Rape culture is the presence of pop culture or mindset that rape is sometimes either condonable or excusable. To really understand what ""rape culture"" means, you have to have **a working definition of what rape is.**  As I pointed out, this has changed over the years, and many would say that it hasn't enough.  However, even to the extent it has changed, rape that is not legally condoned is still condoned publicly.  For example, for many Barney Stinson from HIMYM was a rapist. However, he was glorified as a ""player"" and was the favorite character of many because of his shenanigans.  Condoning his behavior is evidence rape culture to those who believe that rape includes consent through deception.  However, what about people who do not include receiving consent through deception in their definition of rape? Those who believe that rape is evidence through deception would believe that those people perpetuate the culture.  That is just one example.

We can work with our legal definitions of rape to find that rape culture exists. If you polled a bunch of people and asked them when they believe forced sex is okay or sex without consent is okay, if you got any responses that say that it is okay in certain scenarios, you have evidence of ""rape culture,"" the idea that rape is condonable or excusable in certain contexts. [These](http://www.uic.edu/depts/owa/sa_rape_support.html) [exist](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/module4.html) (you'll have to scroll down a bit to find statistics listed in the second link), especially in [cultures that are less gender neutral than others.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/study-61-of-men-don-t-see-forced-sex-with-acquaintance-as-rape-1.337637).  Note that the surveys are not effective if they ask ""When is rape okay.""  They need to ask when sex is okay in certain contexts (forced, without consent) to get honest answers, because many people don't understand, or even agree, on what constitutes rape.  That is why rape culture exists. Also because a bunch of people think **Blurred Lines**, a song that is literally about date rape, should be a #1 song (Now Weird Al's *Word crimes*, that is a hit imo, though I disagree with his views on the Oxford comma)."	cl88k9x	t1_cl84fuv	Reborn33	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I don't see how I was making your point unless you were initially confusing the definition of subjective and objective and we are actually in agreement.  If something can be objectively defined it wouldn't rely on individual interpretation to determine what should be done.

If deceit leading to sex was rape then all instances of those things intersecting would be easy to evaluate.   

Clearly that's not the case, I don't think anyone would genuinely try to argue that exaggerating how attractive/funny/intelligent/interesting you find someone and then getting lucky would be rape.

"Oh, of course we have a legal definition of rape.  My point is that many people consider/call things rape that aren't legally considered rape.  Barney is the perfect example of this, he doesn't do anything that is illegal, yet you and others consider what he does rape.  That is exactly what I was trying to point out.  

In a debate about whether or not we have a ""rape culture"" it very much matters how you define rape when you are trying to make that evaluation, and if different people have significantly different definitions of the term, it seems clear why people might have differing takes on whether or not we have a ""rape culture"".  

Another obvious example:  Two very intoxicated (what people might call too drunk to consent) people have drunkenly consensual sex.  Were both of them raped?  Neither of them? Only one of them?  There is no objectively correct answer.  Some people would point to it as an example of rape culture, others think that calling that situation rape misuses and dilutes the term in reference to what they perceive as ""real rape""."	cmy59he	t1_cmy33ya	GymIn26Minutes	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Everything is a matter of degree.  No, preventative advice, even after the fact, is not victim blaming, it's threat mitigation.  And yet, actual victim blaming happens all the time.  I suspect the mistake you're making is that you're expecting everyone's opinions/beliefs/behaviors to be well within the realm of sound, reasonable thought.  This is a mistake.

The number of times I've actually heard someone explicitly say, in response to a news story about rape, that the victim _deserved it_... this is distinct from ""could have done something to prevent it"" - these people insisted that the victim _shouldn't have_ prevented it because it ought to have happened.

The other part of rape culture is where it is acceptable to casually violate consent.  In the pickup scene there are techniques to get around ""last minute resistance"".  Guys in college joke about having sex with blacked out chicks (the implication being that they're specifically doing it to get around informed consent) or even specifically drugging them.

On top of that, entire institutions will protect rapists if they are stars at sports, as an example.

These kinds of things are not straw men, they actually happen, and they are culturally acceptible.  [Just because a lot of very vocal people take the the concept too far and start lumping legitimate behaviors into ""rape culture"" does not mean rape culture is not a thing.  That's like believing the government is not spying on us because it sounds like something conspiracy theorists believe.  Sometimes a broken clock is right.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/)

Despite what you and many others on the internet say, I can seriously say that I've never heard anyone say that someone deserved to be raped in person.

I'd say the primary aspect of cases like the Steubenville one is sports players being granted immunity from their crimes, (which is part of a larger problem of people taking sports too seriously) not that the crime that happened to be committed was rape. Ray Rice's beating of his wife wasn't investigated until controversy forced the NFL to do so.

I'm not making any point in general about this topic and I do agree with your comment, but I think this is a pretty common fallacy.
 
It took me a while to really internalize this, but the US is a big, big country.  What you see in your community and your everyday life, as vast as the sum of all your personal connections may seem, is a tiny tiny biased sample of overall attitudes.   You simply can't assume it's representative of the US overall in any way.  As an example, out of the 100s of people I call friends and acquaintances, I know one person who would be classified as obese.  And yet, the obesity rate in America is 35%.  My sample, as large as it may seem (""everyone I know"") has approximately 1/100th the incidence of obesity that America does.  I'm sure if you think about it, you could think of plenty of examples like this where the people in your environment collectively have a very different breakdown on an issue than the country at large does.

Proper scientific polls don't use the word in question, since that always carries some preconceptions. A good scientific poll would contain a lot of different questions about what people would find acceptable and not, and the scientists would then compare those responses to their definition of rape and see if people found rape acceptable.

The only way to answer that question is through empirical evidence.

"You're talking about sociology here, where a poll is not necessarily good data. You are more likely to engage in a critical discourse analysis or something similar, than a poll, which would yield virtually worthless results.

Anecdotal evidence and empirical evidence are not mutually exclusive. Empirical evidence is evidence which can be observed. One can observe evidence for rape culture everywhere. It is a fact that it exists, because rape exists. That is quite literally all the evidence you need to find out whether rape culture exists.

What you want to know is how prevalent rape culture is. Which is an unanswerable question. Because you can't define culture in units or in any form of objective measurement, and there is no way to objectively measure how ""big"" a part of our culture, rape culture occupies. All you can do is look at advertising, media, and analysis discourse in real settings to determine how rape is discussed, and how it is perceived.

"&gt; Of course nobody is going to answer yes to a gallup asking whether rape is acceptable.

You'd be surprised.  As long as you don't use the word ""rape"" but simply describe the acts, plenty of people will admit to having committed rape or thinking that it would be acceptable to do so.

"I agree that you could get a LOT of information out from polls - people aren't that afraid of admitting their opinions especially if you don't use the word rape itself.

However, I'd be really worried about people having agendas in such things.

For example I could easily imagine a question like:
""Have you ever had an one night stand with a girl who was totally wasted?""

My answer would be ""yes"". Now, am I a rapist? 

I'd say with 100% certainty I was the more wasted one (I blacked out significant chunks of the evening, and never quite could trace the events that led me to her flat, to a degree that I had some trouble navigating my way out from it without GPS back when. To this day I have no clue where we met for example, though there's a foggy image of a bar), which the question kind of forgets to ask. I'm actually not even sure she was particularly drunk, I mainly assumed as much considering I must not have been at my most charming if I've blacked out much of the evening.
 
To not implicate myself and my gender for dubious reasons, I might lie as an answer to the question because I feel a ""no"" would yield more honest results than the most likely honest ""yes"". This is a problem, obviously enough.



Still, it'd be interesting to see a properly neutral survey done, because I do feel it could shed a lot of light on this (and actually result in a meaningful conversation - the current one often feels TERRIBLY agenda and ideology driven vs being data driven)."	cl81gtl	t1_cl800sx	Delheru	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"For every person who says they constantly hear ""She deserved to be raped"" I see far more people saying they've never heard that in real life. This suggests that internet comments show that rape culture is not a thing.

I would agree it suggests that mass rape culture doesn't exist, but not that rape culture doesn't exist at all.  I'd say it implies people are unwilling to say those things in public, which is good because people think (hopefully rightly) that public opinion of them will turn sour pretty quickly if they do.

I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course, rape are thievery are different.

I think that some feminists confuse these two, placing both of them in the realm of ""rape culture"". Personally, I do not think that victims of any serious, mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight.

"&gt; It took me a while to really internalize this, but the US is a big, big country. What you see in your community and your everyday life, as vast as the sum of all your personal connections may seem, is a tiny tiny biased sample of overall attitudes. You simply can't assume it's representative of the US overall in any way. As an example, out of the 100s of people I call friends and acquaintances, I know one person who would be classified as obese. And yet, the obesity rate in America is 35%. My sample, as large as it may seem (""everyone I know"") has approximately 1/100th the incidence of obesity that America does. I'm sure if you think about it, you could think of plenty of examples like this where the people in your environment collectively have a very different breakdown on an issue than the country at large does.

"I am almost positive you have heard something similar to ""they deserved to be raped."" Have you ever heard someone snidely say, ""he's going to be some big guy's bitch in prison,"" or some such variation? There is no difference between that, and saying someone deserved to be raped. Male prison rape is the origin of the whole rape culture thing to begin with, and is the only meaningful example of it in society so far as I am concerned.

"Ignoring internet trolls, that's honestly the only context in which I've ever heard of anyone saying something which could be interpreted as ""pro-rape"": when it referred to a ""very bad guy"" going to prison and ""getting what he deserved"" in the form of prison rape. Well, that and maybe consensual statutory ""rape"" between two people of close age where one of them has not technically reached the legal age of consent; and honestly, I don't think that should be placed in the same bucket.

But that doesn't seem to be what people are talking about when they say there's a ""rape culture,"" is it? I've pretty much never seen the people who talk about ""rape culture"" emphasizing the need to stop prison rape or support victims of it. I'm personally in complete agreement that that's a problem; the normalization of prison rape as punishment is not okay.

Overall, I think the OP is basically right, at least in the U.S. What percentage of people in the Western world aren't vehemently against rape? I have to imagine it's a tiny, tiny minority. I see cultural problems with gender role expectations and homophobia, ""slut-shaming"", and certainly people using insensitive language like ""I raped that test,"" but I certainly don't see it as a norm to actually trivialize actual sexual violence (except in the specific context of prison rape)."	cl7vtah	t1_cl7qn3v	Glayden	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"As people mentioned in this thread, there are a lot of people who are pretty open about these rape ideas and many others who indirectly support them by focusing on victim-blaming rather than looking at the rapists. 

Also, I don't agree with concepts like ""sin"" or ""evil"" or anything that amounts to a buzzword. It's oversimplifying the situation for no benefit other than going on the emotional offensive. I would say your use of ""MONSTER"" falls perfectly in that category. As hard as it may be to consider, it absolutely is only a cultural issue. I think about cultural bias constantly. For example, some situations of ""molestation"" would absolutely be less damaging than the widely accepted types of genital cutting we do to babies at birth. Many people would excuse that, yet if they really consider their own situation, how often would they say it seems okay for someone to cut away at their genitals? The excuse is that it's okay because babies don't remember the pain... If that's an argument, non-violent types of molestation should be completely okay to do to infants below a certain age. They won't remember, *and* they don't have to experience extreme pain. Not to mention past cultures that involved sexuality with younger adolescents and children. I somewhat firmly believe most mental issues children experience from non-violent molestation are undoubtedly due to society's ***extremely*** negative perception about sexuality and the idea of ""innocence"" that we place on a pedestal. The fact that virginity is such a huge focus and issue perfectly expresses that idea. The only real fears about sexuality should be births and STDs. If both were blocked/cured, what harm is sexuality?

Oh, and to add to this, the creation of legal age restriction is a recent thing. Humans mostly developed with women bearing children shortly after they started their period. People talk about Muhammad marrying a 9 year old or whatever, but I've also heard the ""Virgin Mary"" was 12 years old at the time. Whether that's true or not, it wouldn't have actually been strange for that time. That culture surely wholly accepted it."	cl82onf	t1_cl82fo8	AKnightAlone	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I'm honestly pretty questionable about the ""rape culture"" idea, myself. Seeing this thread actually made an idea pop in my mind later... I believe humanity is inherently a culture of rape. When I think about the *immense* amount of time required for species to evolve and grow, the strongest species will always be the most efficient. Rape is efficient. It spreads genes despite a person's capability for garnering attraction. I have absolutely no doubt that none of the people alive today would exist if rape had never happened among our ancestors. As a philosophical/moral argument, to remove rape from the human species would ultimately be the genocide of everyone currently alive. That point in particular implies that we're inherently a rape culture. Our genes exist because somewhere along the line someone was raped. Looking at life as if there is inherent value and ignoring quality of life, rape practically becomes a good thing.

A girl at my college recently got gang raped and it was caught on video, SO many people supported the guys who did the raping. They said she deserved it around being drunk around the guys, and maybe she sent the guys wrong signals (she was repeatedly saying no on the video).

These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket.

In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course, rape are thievery are different.

I'm sure I know one or two people who might blame a rape on the amount a drinks a girl had, but I remain confident that I don't know anyone who would blame it on the clothes she's wearing. Regardless I don't think anywhere near a majority of people blames rape on anyone but the rapist, especially in very black and white cases of rape where there were other witnesses around, bruises or marks left on the victim, or any other hard evidence to prove that the victim's story is the truth. I think many people are hesitant to convict someone without enough evidence to do so, but I wouldn't call that rape culture. 	cl7se58	t1_cl7r6df	MCskeptic	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

I thought that too, and then friends would actually get raped and people that I never believed would blame the victim, blamed the victim. They didn't even realize they were blaming the victim. It goes past just being hesitant too convict someone without proof, they just inherently don't believe the victim. You're assuming you don't know anyone, just like I assumed I didn't know anyone. My roommate was in a sorority and I hung out with a lot of her friends. A girl in the sorority got raped by a person in another fraternity, so they tried to cut of ties to that fraternity (since the fraternity took no steps to punish the guy) and a number of girls were very against it. They didn't even believe their close friend. I think it's more common than you think. 	cl7y63t	t1_cl7se58	HollaDude	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Why should people inherently believe the victim? The ""rapist"" could be the victim in this case if it wasn't actually rape. We really don't know who the victim is unless we saw it happen or had evidence it was rape. This type of stuff should go through the police. Let the professionals take care of it, and let the students stay out of it. They don't have much business in taking sides in a situation they really know nothing about other than ""he said, she said.""

"&gt; Despite what you and many others on the internet say, I can seriously say that I've never heard anyone say that someone deserved to be raped in person. I've seen it on the news and the internet but I've never actually seen that happen with my own eyes. This leads me to believe that this occurrence happens a lot less often than some say it does.

I don't mean to sound like a dick with this, hopefully I don't: are you a white male? I ask because it's very easy to not see what happens when it doesn't affect you - to not notice comments that aren't relevant to you. What you're describing is a very standard cognitive bias - ""I have not seen X therefore it is not likely that X is as prevalent as people say it is."" That bias is why I ask.

As a rape victim, I can assure you the culture is very real. I cannot talk about it. When I reported it, I was laughed at and turned away *by the police.* I mentioned it to one family member and was mocked. The friends I've talked to about it *blamed* me. 

People are quick to *say* they're opposed to rape and find it despicable, but they turn a blind eye to it with a quickness. Rape culture is the victim blaming and shaming that keeps it from being reported. It's the tacit acceptance of the shame and blame. It's ruling that people are responsible for making sure they don't get raped, rather than punishing people who rape. 

It's rules that victim blame, such as banning shorter-than-knee-length skirts, It's putting the onus on the victim to not be assaulted. Don't walk the street at night, don't walk to your car alone, don't accept help from men who stop if your car has broken down, don't go to the bathroom alone at the bar, don't get too drunk, don't go out alone with male friends, so on and so forth.

"&gt;I don't mean to sound like a dick with this, hopefully I don't: are you a white male? I ask because it's very easy to not see what happens when it doesn't affect you - to not notice comments that aren't relevant to you. What you're describing is a very standard cognitive bias - ""I have not seen X therefore it is not likely that X is as prevalent as people say it is."" That bias is why I ask.

i'm not the person you quoted, but that's completely irrelevant. the idea that white men aren't capable of understanding matters like this is blatantly stereotyping and needs to stop.

i'm a non-white male, and i am the same; i have never actually heard anyone saying anything like that.

&gt;As a rape victim, I can assure you the culture is very real.

that's terrible and all, but that doesn't make it real.

&gt;Basically, women are expected to give up the freedom to enjoy themselves to accommodate rapists. How about instead of teaching women not to walk to their car alone at night, teaching everyone not to rape?

because we already know not to rape. we live in an anti-rape culture. anti-rape messages are embedded so deeply into society that it's something that goes without saying. i'm sorry to hear that you are a victim, but that doesn't excuse the constant blaming of society. that solves nothing."	cl7z9q5	t1_cl7vvax	sarkcarter	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

This might be the case, but this certainly isn't a widely view. Most people would say that she didn't 'deserve' it, most people are rational and relatively well informed, the few that aren't might be more noticeable, however. I feel that what you have stated doesn't contradict OP, as 'rape culture' refers to vast amounts of people, and your examples are only the minority. Perhaps things are different in the US (I am from the UK), but 'rape culture' has always seemed ridiculous to me. No one I know or have ever known would be cool with drugging a girl, or getting her wasted to have sex with her. 	cl7hi2y	t1_cl7g94l	xHelpless	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I'm from London and had my first 'rape culture' discussion about a month ago. It's permeating over here slowly I guess. The woman I was talking to implied that all men are rapist and that at the same time ""men can't get raped because at some level if they get an erection they wanted to do it!""

I was a bit shocked that someone can be so hypocritical, but was relatively unsurprised as she has a very limited grasp on reality.

"Your ability to make sound decisions goes out the door when you're between the phases of unable to drive and stumbling on the floor. There are many men who prey on these girls.

I know you feel it's still their responsibility to take care of themselves, but it's really not that simple. We have a society that promotes heavy drinking from the ages of 18-22, despite legality. Can we really expect an 18 year old college freshman to have the judgment to know when to stop? Can you really say they're perfectly capable of making their own decisions the first time they drink heavily?

If you were making an argument that America has a binge drinking culture problem that would be a valid point.

"The binge drinking culture is what I'm saying detracts from a simple ""women have agency"" argument. There are a ton of social factors which may push a person to drink more, and in the case of women, the result of getting too drunk (which happens to people of all genders, certainly) can often be unwanted sexual contact or experiences.

"Why? I accepted every drink they gave me. I could have said no at any time. I went home with them. I got into bed with them. I got naked with them. I never told them no.

&gt;it would make sense that it would be rape for both genders....and we can see that it isn't.

it is, however it is much more common for it to be man on woman so that is what is discussed, there is no implication the other way is impossible.

&gt;Plying a human with alcohol is the issue

that is exactly what  I argued, although if the endgame of plying a human with alcohol is to have non-consensual sex with them it is also rape.

The drunk sex is not what makes it rape the intent of skirting around the fact that you would not normally be given consent by purposely and maliciously impairing their judgement is what makes it rape. this is incredibly hard to prove which is why I mentioned it being a gray-area.

"&gt;Pushing drinks on someone doesn't actually forces them to drink the stuff, they are still completely free to say no. 

Forces someone to drink, no. Manipulation with malicious intent? Oh ya. Common. I think maybe eriophora was touching on that. 

Offering more drinks to someone who clearly doesn't need anymore, hoping they'll get so drunk they'll become incapable of even being able to say no, does happen. 

I think you are ignoring an important factor here or not considering it, that higher levels of intoxication equate to lesser levels of proper cognitive brain function. A drunk person can say no, the problem is the drunk might be too intoxicated to realize it's the wise choice.

"There's a difference between being Equal and being unaccountable for what you put into your body. 

If the same woman drinks that much and gets into a car, she is not a victim.  It is only sex where a drunk woman suddenly loses all of her equality and ability to control her own destiny or live with the consequences of her actions.

Aside from the fact that one is committing a crime and the other is being a victim of a crime, drunk driving is a statutory crime. It requires no intent to do harm, only proof that you drove while intoxicated. Consent, on the other hand, is all about intent. If you don't have the mental capacity to understand what you're doing you can't form intent and you can't consent. Someone having sex with you when you can't consent is a crime and the fact that the victim can't consent because they've been drinking doesn't mitigate the perpatrator's responsobilty.  DUI laws apply equally regardless of gender and so do consent laws.  	cl7qkq4	t1_cl7ofdt	latebloomingginger	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Rape and sexual assault are usually general intent crimes, like drunk driving.  The act itself is enough, the courts don't need to prove you meant to do it so voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense. If both parties are contributing equally in the physical aspects of sex and no other evidence of coercion, explicit denial of consent,  force or diminished capacity is evident, you'd have a hard time getting a rape conviction for either party. However, if one person is doing most of the action while the other person is displaying signs of not being ""with it"" enough to consent, eg confusion,  lapsing in and out of consciousness, etc. the party doing the action is the one who's in the wrong, even if they're intoxicated too.

Unless there is a video recording of the whole sex shenigans, you won't be able to prove that one person was ""drunker"" than the other etc.

I think we should point out the difference between actively getting someone to blackout, and them doing it of their own volition. If you drank to the point of a walking black out and have sex, and gave consent at the time, you were not raped. You might regret it, and you might not have given consent if you were sober but at the end of the day you changed your mental state of your own free will and gave consent to someone.

Yeah but for it to be a culture it has to be seen as alright by a large proportion of people and honestly there are very few people who I have ever met that think rape is okay. The only way the term rape culture applies to most western nations is if you expand the definition if rape to include things like catcalling, asking someone out on a date, and simply looking at women. Most people think those things are either ok, or at least not rape. But many are trying to redefine rape to mean anything that is remotely sexual that women don't like.	cl8a3hk	t1_cl7v4d1	Metzger90	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

A culture that encourages unwelcome sexual advances is going to encourage rapey behaviors in people who are less ethically or socially developed.  That's what I think of when I think of rape culture.  It's not that everyone thinks that rape is okay.  It's that it fosters an environment where people who are more on the unethical end think that rape is okay.	cl8f6fy	t1_cl8a3hk	JLTeabag	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

What if a person consents to rape a girl but is a little bit drunk.  Since they can't be held accountable for their actions while drunk, shouldn't they not be charged with rape?	cl7p0jm	t1_cl7odxf	DumpyLips	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course, rape are thievery are different.

I think that some feminists confuse these two, placing both of them in the realm of ""rape culture"". Personally, I do not think that victims of any serious, mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight.

Yes. If you make a choice to drink to the point of not remembering what happened while you were drunk, you still have the ability to give consent. If you join the military while you are blacked out you can't use that as an excuse to not follow through. If we say that consent can't be given while we are drunk, we kind of have to get rid of laws associate with drunk driving. You are basically telling people that while they are under the influence they are not responsible for their actions, other people are.	cl7me46	t1_cl7lgc0	Metzger90	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"You can in some states, and in other countries, consent to doctor assisted suicide. I think it's relevant because if I consent, and you have sex with me, it's ok. If I don't consent and you have sex with me, it's rape. If I consent and you help me kill myself, it's ok. If I don't consent and you ""help"" me kill myself, it's murder.

Now we get back to the nuance of what constitutes legitimate consent, which was the point of my question.

"&gt; Get a part time job for minimum wage and make friends with some of your co-workers

I have done just that, and most of them are well meaning individuals. I may have gone to university to study philosophy, but I am certainly from a lower income household. You shouldn't assume things based on my interests, and certainly shouldn't assume I am a 'nerd' (unless of course your working definition of a 'nerd' is someone who enjoys philosophy and tabletop games). Whilst I've certainly not spent a great deal of time with the lowest of the income brackets, I would stick to my statement about holding at least a basic rationale, and well informed about such basic concepts of rape and consent. 

I've also done quite a bit of study on feminism as part of my degree, and there are certainly tonnes of gender inequalities, but the term 'rape culture' thrown around by tumblr and the like tends not to really mean much. It is a confused term that people generally attach to events that they have been threatened of felt uncomfortable. Using such a strong term as 'rape' to describe this, I find, is terrible, as it only serves to devalue the very important problem of actual rape.

"Concerning the whole 'get a job for minimum wage thing... 

I definitely used to be very doubting of people who complained about how guys behaved towards girls, because I had *never seen it happen.* The people I grew up with and the people I spend time with don't act like that. However. This summer I took a job landscaping, and holy shit did that change how I looked at things. These guys were constantly making catcalls, whistling, and shouting decidedly inappropriate things at just about any girl we drove past. And then, as we drove off, they would say stuff like ""Did you see her face? We just made her day,"" and ""aw yeah, she liked that,"" etc. 

Just because we have had the good fortune to grow up around good role models and have had the opportunity to go to college with like-minded people, doesn't mean that everyone in the world acts the way we're used to.

Personally, though I think that 'rape culture' has been somewhat sensationalized by its proponents - looking at you, tumblr - the issues its based on certainly exist. There are guys who believe that if they do something nice for a girl, or take her out, they're entitled to sex. There are guys who think that every girl wants the crass form of attention they want to give. There are guys who think that if a girl doesn't want to have sex with them, it's because there's something wrong with her. There are guys who say 'She was asking for it', 'Dressing like that? She totally wanted it', etc. And there are guys who think that if a girl's drunk, she's fair game. 

These guys are more common than you'd think.

"Well perhaps it _is_ different in america (but I suspect it isn't).  At least here, entire towns rally behind high school and college sports teams who gang raped someone.  Victims of rape at the hands of high profile members of the community are discouraged from coming forward about it, institutionally.

There are widespread programs to clarify the nature of consent to college students because rape is a problem on college campuses.  Rape culture is the environment in which a guy thinks he can hold a girl who says ""get a condom first"" down and fuck her bare because she went on a date with him and wanted to have sex, where people who have raped someone think they can't be rapists because they didn't assault a stranger in a dark alley.

I've made this case other places in this thread (which were subsequently reported for upsetting people) but places like Fox News are frankly on the side of the rapists in these cases. Peopel on reddit see Fox News as this abstract ridiculous network. But guess what. A MASSIVE portion of the population in America see them otherwise.

"&gt; While colleges have tried to protect players on their sports teams in the past, they are isolated incidents and when the public found out, people were outraged.

That seems overly optimistic. These cases are brought to the public's attention when someone outside of the institution blows the whistle. There is seldom if ever a case of an institution like a sports team expelling a successful coach or star athlete without being forced to by public pressure.

This strongly implies that these institutions do not police themselves. (Sort of how flagrant police misconduct is frequently only uncovered by a third party recording an incident, because cops cover for each other.) This is the *opposite* of it being a set of isolated incidents.

&gt; I don't know of anyone who thinks holding a girl down against her will is ever okay, and I associate with a wide variety of people.

Right; people don't say that. People will say that she wanted it, so it wasn't against her will, or that she was sending mixed signals, and the we shouldn't hold a simple miscommunication against the guy, or that it never happened and she's just trying to tar his good name."	cl7usjt	t1_cl7jdlg	grendel-khan	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Well, I can only speak for the US.  But your description of what it is like there is almost exactly how it is here as well.  I think the most likely case is that people who believe it exists will find evidence for it that seems quite convincing to them, in the same way some people find evidence of a deity in the universe that others don't consider evidence.  The truth is, the vast majority of men and women are not sexual predators, and a likely equal and equally tiny percentage of both genders possess the psychological propensity to commit such an act.  The fact is though, that tiny percent is going to keep raping regardless of culture, and so to those that want to see it, there will always be evidence of a 'rape culture'

Really?  I think the majority of people are capable psychologically of commiting rape.  Armies are full of pretty normal people, and there are lots of stories of groups of soldiers raping people.

Edit:  Pretty much everyone can have their morals affected by stress and cultural conditions so much that they're capable of committing atrocious acts. Most people would not rape under current cultural conditions, but some people do.  Can you really know that those people would still rape in different conditions?  If what you're saying is true, then rape rates wouldn't be affected by culture. "	cl7ojty	t1_cl7js55	JLTeabag	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"No one does this in America? Did you miss the whole scandal in [Steubenville, OH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case)? 

For those who don't know the case, a girl got drunk and passed out at a high school party. Then several members of the football team spent the night physically transporting her unconscious body to multiple locations, photographed and filmed themselves sexually abusing her, and posted videos and tweets online about how hilarious it was. 

Then the cops deleted the photos on the phones they initially confiscated, and the investigation stopped cold. The only reason anybody heard about it at all is that Anonymous got involved, posted the identities of the rapists, and reposted pictures and videos that had been taken down. 

If some hackers hadn't decided to go vigilante on the case, however, the town would have just let some football players get away with rape because it's a football town."	cl7opwm	t1_cl7j6ax	MrApophenia	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I'm just going to tack this on here, because I think you're being narrow minded when you focus on how often you've heard people say the rape victim deserved it. The other day in my class (I teach middle school) one of my boys was about fight another one of my boys because the other boy asked his girlfriend to go out with him. ""She's mine, and he's trying to take her from me"". Never once did he think to ask his girlfriend ""Do you like him? Would you leave me to date him?"" or to even consider that she had agency in the situation or that her feelings or preferences mattered. In his mind, she was a commodity that another boy could just come over and take. *That* is a symptom of rape culture, as well. Women are things you enjoy, not people you talk to. Women are things to have sex with, and it doesn't matter what *their* desires are because they don't have emotions - they're there for me, they're mine.

I actually watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko) today, which is another great example of how rape culture is so much more than just blaming the victim. Part of rape culture includes the ""fact"" that boys can't be raped. It's the same part of rape culture that dismiss men who make offensive comments to women as ""just acting on instinct"", as if men are generally incapable of controlling how they act on their desires. ""Men will be men,"" people will say after a woman ""bitches"" about how she is getting cat-called. ""Don't wear such a low-cut shirt; men can't help themselves when they see a pretty woman.""

Rape culture isn't just blaming the victim of an actual rape. This is all part of rape culture."	cl7mi2n	t1_cl7hvp4	ghostofmybrain	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

You're using middle schoolers as an example? Children? I don't think that's the best anecdotal example to use. Have you never heard or seen a woman lay claim to their boyfriend before? Or two women fighting over a guy before? It's reasonable to expect that a person that you're in a monogamous relationship with is yours and yours alone until the relationship ends. Saying that he/she is mine is something people just do to convey that the person they're with is in a relationship with them and that it's distasteful for someone to try to sabotage that.	cl7qj6g	t1_cl7mi2n	Daeil	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"How can you state that everything is 'a matter of degree' when the name given to this phenomenom is 'rape culture'? The naming alone is so suggestive and provocative that it will eliminate any sense of 'degree' in a persons mind who's yet to come across the term -'What? we live in a culture of rape? are you kidding me?'

You state that you've heard many times people saying that 'they deserved it' as if this is an argument that we live in a rape culture. If therefore I state that I've heard many times people proclaiming the opposite - that the victim didn't deserve it, that the responsibility lies with the perpetrator - then you must also concede that I can use those people to claim that we're living in 'anti-rape culture' society, and my argument will be equally as valid as your own.

That is obviously a problem. Two countering viewpoints like that cannot co-exist.

In regards to 'casually violating consent'; the fact is, in many of the scenarios that are common talking points - people being drunk, the 'playing hard to get' - the notion of 'consent' isn't clear cut. Dialogue surrounding this espouses ideal situations in which partners give each other the go ahead - a yes please, or a no thank you - when anyone who's had a modicum of interaction with people and society know that language and communication is ambiguous, is complex, is nuanced, and can be difficult to navigate. There are times when yes can mean no, and no can mean yes. Flirting, joking, attraction, seduction all rely on complex communication to work. I'm not ready to state we live in a culture of rape because people make jokes about it, because some guys give it everything they've got to persuade (which is what it is - persuasion, not coercion) women to sleep with them. 

As to your final statements - institutions protect those valuable to them all the time, even criminals, and this isn't something that's limited to rape. 

I'll part with words from RAINN. RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network) is America’s largest and most influential anti-sexual-violence organization. This is what they had to say about 'rape culture'.

&gt;In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture” for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campus. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important not to lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.

And a final quote from a Time article reporting on RAINN:

&gt;RAINN urges the White House to “remain focused on the true cause of the problem” and suggests a three-pronged approach for combating rape: empowering community members through bystander intervention education, using “risk-reduction messaging” to encourage students to increase their personal safety and promoting clearer education on “where the ‘consent line’ is.” It also asserts that we should treat rape like the serious crime it is by giving power to trained law enforcement rather than internal campus judicial boards.

"&gt; The number of times I've actually heard someone explicitly say, in response to a news story about rape, that the victim deserved it...

How did you react? How do you expect the average person on the street to react to someone saying, ""that woman completely deserved to be brutally raped""?

I very seriously doubt that person would be met with a chorus of supportive voices. The opposite is most commonly true, and people view the person making that statement as pretty horrible.

So what does that say about the culture? Maybe the odd person has that point of view, but the overwhelming majority would chastise that person for it because they're conditioned by society to view rape for what it is - a horrible crime.

&gt; The other part of rape culture is where it is acceptable to casually violate consent.

That's generally viewed as *acceptable* by society? Society *encourages* this? If you asked the average person on the street they wouldn't flinch to say that this is acceptable?

&gt; On top of that, entire institutions will protect rapists if they are stars at sports, as an example.

Entire institutions protect thieves, drunk drivers, tax evaders, and people who commit all sorts of crimes of all kinds if they are sports stars, movie stars, or any other kind of star.

"I'd actually say that OP is arguing for victim blaming. His analogy with the thief makes no sense. What advice do you give a survivor of rape/attempted rape??

&gt; ""Uh, well, um, just be stronger than them?""

Does no one else see how ludicrous this is?

Most rapes are not violent-stranger rapes -- they are usually perpetrated by people that the survivor knows or is acquainted with. [73% of sexual assaults are committed by non-strangers](https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders). 

&gt;First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists.

Yes, they are punished severely *only sometimes out of the few times we actually lock them away*. [Most of the time they get away with it](https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates). Out of the number of reports, most reported rapes do not even lead to an arrest. 

But before you say ""oh, but most of those are probably false reports anyway"", [do your homework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Crown_Prosecution_Service_report_.282011.E2.80.932012.29). Which gives us one of many reasons why there are also a lot of unreported rapes. Not only are reported rapes not taken seriously (also speaking from experience, here), but even when someone does report a rape there is a whole fucking mountain of red tape they have to go through. The retelling of the rape, explaining, questioning, and dragging the entire process out over an extended period of time is enough to discourage someone from reporting the rape because it pushes back the point at which the survivor can move on from the event and not have his/her life defined by rape. 

And, excuse me for the salt, but OP is just making no sense here by trying to bring up analogies that make no sense and then saying, ""wait, I know it doesn't *really* apply all that well to rape... but doesn't it?!?"" We aren't given much to work with in terms of why OP doesn't think rape culture is a thing other than ""I don't really think it's a thing"". Either you think it's a thing or you don't -- there is no ""it's hardly a thing, which is my nice PC way of saying I don't think it's a thing so people will think I'm reasonable"".

There are a lot of smart people that have written and talked about rape culture and it's hard to address OP's CMV if he/she doesn't want to address any of the foundational pieces on it.

As a side note, there was an AskReddit thread two years ago about rape from the rapists point of view. [All of the posts have been deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/), but you can find some cherrypicked quotes online if you look for them.

EDIT:

&gt; The other part of rape culture is where it is acceptable to casually violate consent. In the pickup scene there are techniques to get around ""last minute resistance"". Guys in college joke about having sex with blacked out chicks (the implication being that they're specifically doing it to get around informed consent) or even specifically drugging them.

Totally on board with your post, lolbifrons, and I'd say that this is true outside of college (though I don't mean to suggest that it is prevalent  or everywhere). I know that for many people it is hard to imagine, but when you tell someone attempting to violate you ""no"", they take it as a ""yes"" and say things like ""I know you want it"", etc. It's all about violating consent to get what they want -- [they justify it or downplay it later](https://www.d.umn.edu/~bmork/2306/readings/scullyandmarollis.htm). 

from xHelpless:
&gt; most people are rational and relatively well informed

No, most people aren't, and that's part of the problem. This is why lolbifrons brought up the kind of people he assumed you surrounded yourself with. But besides that, being ""rational"" does not mean someone will not try to rape someone. Everyone tries to rationalize everything they do -- even when it's stupid; even when it's rape.

Good infographic, but it makes a lot of assumptions. The average [rapist has around 6 victims](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/05/01/campus_sexual_assault_statistics_so_many_victims_but_not_as_many_predators.html). So it might be more prudent to say out of 100 rapes (committed by ~17 rapists) 3 perpetrators go to prison.

Another thing that no one mentions is that these cases can't be prosecuted if they aren't reported. Absolutely nothing can be done about that 60%.

[There is also some data suggesting](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/19/myths-about-rape-conviction-rates) that the wrongly touted low 'conviction' rates for rape discourage victims from coming forward. The 3/100 figure (I've seen 3-8%) is attrition rate, which isn't calculated for  other crimes.

"In regards to your point about false rape claims:

&gt;David Lisak's study, published in 2010 in Violence Against Women, classified as false 8 out of the 136 (5.9%) reported rapes at an American university over a ten-year period.

http://www.icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf

And, that is a minimum bound - since those are only the ones quite sure to be false.

A 6% minimum false rape claim rate is no small issue.

Edit: Forgot to add, these studies are only done about rape claims made to police. Meaning, at least 6% of rape claims made to police are false. 

What about unofficial rape claims (to friends, family, employers, educational institutions)? These are often very damaging (though less so than false claims to police)  - and would have a much higher rate of false accusations.

"This is the other edge of the poisonous sword.  Rape is a real threat to women, but the allegation of it can be swung like a WMD to ruin a man's life.  If John met Sue at a bar last night, shared a couple drinks, and Sue invited John in, Sue could feel embarrassed or worse the next day, spread rumors that John tricked her into entering her apartment under some other auspice and raped her.  Even if it just reaches their immediate social circles, it goes nothing short of viral and John will be ruined at work, lose friends, possibly have to move, even if he is legally absolved of wrongdoing.  Rape culture would tell us that no matter what, John raped Sue on some level.  Even if she was just trying to blow off some steam from a bad week of work, a recent break-up, and wanted to cut loose and have a one night stand.  

Like abusing children, men sexually accused of assaulting women are met with unquestioned and unquenchable vitriol.

"Indeed.

People like to pretend that anyone who thinks false accusations are a problem are paranoid conspiracy lunatics who hate women.

In reality, you have [shit like this](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/false-abuse-accusations-against-teachers-on-the-rise-1.1173682):

&gt;But in a study conducted at Nipissing University, entitled ""A Report on the Professional Journey of Male Primary-Junior teachers in Ontario,"" nearly 13 per cent of male educators said they had been falsely accused. The study had 223 respondents across Ontario.

You have people repeating the myth that ""no woman would choose to report a rape if it never happened, because reporting is traumatizing and harmful.""

In reality, there are many, many stories of women making false rape reports - to police - for the most trivial of reasons, [like not wanting to pay cab fare](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2009/05/15/edmonton-cab-driver-lawsuit.html).

And of course, those are only the ones that make the news - only the rape claims to police. Unofficial false rape claims don't make the news. 

Most women would never make a false rape claim of course, just as most men would never rape.

But no one pretends that rape doesn't exist."	cl7zyua	t1_cl7zrob	Celda	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Not necessarily: though you can't get thrown in jail for it, you can still get hit for slander/libel if the person can prove that the claim was false and caused them some significant harm.

All that report actually shows is that the number of cases where police prosecute based on false allegation is low.

"Thank you for your rhetorical, hate-filled post, which makes you sound like a rabid squirrel foaming at the keyboard. How can a civil debate make you so angry on the internet?

First of all, good advice certainly exists. Sarcastically saying ""um, be stronger than them"" is either a straw man argument or a failed attempt at humor. ""Don't get blackout drunk"" is an example of good advice, and this goes for everyone, both males and females. You don't need to get blackout drunk to have a good time, and it might save you a hangover, too.

&gt;Do your homework

Do you think that childish insults will change someone's view? You should seriously think about what you're trying to do here. Are you trying to do something constructive or vent at the expense of someone else?

&gt;There's a whole fucking mountain of red tape

So that, um, nobody gets falsely convicted? So that nobody gets thrown into jail for the next ten years for doing something that they never did? And even then, people do, sometimes, get falsely convicted of rape.

&gt;And, excuse me for the salt

""I'm sorry, but""

And as for my analogy, I was pointing out that people will naturally point out what the victim could have done to prevent the crime from happening again. I was pointing out why, sometimes, this advice is not victim blaming and has nothing to do with gender or rape. So next time pull the ""offended"" card more carefully, and read a little more closely. 

&gt;There are a lot of smart people that have written and talked about rape culture and it's hard to address OP's CMV if he/she doesn't want to address any of the foundational pieces on it.

What am I writing here, a thesis? Do you want me to trawl the internet for hours so I can address every single point on a very complicated issue? I don't think you understand what CMV is all about. You're supposed to *help* the poster change his view, not throw around vitriol and have a temper tantrum. 

&gt;Let's say the world assumed rape culture was a thing when it really wasn't

Correctly identifying what ""rape culture"" is *is* important. It doesn't invalidate attempts to curtail rape, either.

"&gt;First of all, good advice certainly exists. 

I wrote something that addresses this fairly directly here ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j196u/cmv_that_rape_culture_does_not_exist_in_a/cl82ssq?context=3)) it's all relevant but the last paragraph is a specific summary.

&gt;Are you trying to do something constructive or vent at the expense of someone else?

He's trying to tell you that there's a lot of academic and political background on rape culture that you seem unaware of. He's venting because that frustrates him.

&gt;So that, um, nobody gets falsely convicted? So that nobody gets thrown into jail for the next ten years for doing something that they never did? And even then, people do, sometimes, get falsely convicted of rape.

Maybe, but FAR FAR FAR less often than actual rapists get away with it or are never reported at all. The ""homework"" this he tried to link you to addresses this in part.


&gt;I was pointing out why, sometimes, this advice is not victim blaming and has nothing to do with gender or rape.

This point is in contention. It is in fact *highly* contentious. I talk about why is a post I made here ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j196u/cmv_that_rape_culture_does_not_exist_in_a/cl82ssq?context=3)). The last paragraph is a summary.

He' s frustrated because you don't seem to be here for help or direction. This *is* a very complicated issue, and there are many aspects of it you appear to be misinformed about or simply unaware of. You clearly understand this, or you wouldn't have said the thing about the thesis.

&gt;I don't think you understand what CMV is all about.

It doesn't feel like you're here to have your view changed. That is, it doesn't feel like you're here to listen to new information and try to absorb different ways of thinking about this topic. It feels like you're here to stake out a position and argue from it, defend your view until it's no longer tenable, and only then admit defeat.

"I posted this elsewhere in the thread, but I think it's appropriate to reply to you as well. I think that it is very narrow minded in a discussion about rape culture to only focus on how we react to people who have actually been raped. I think that narrow-minded focus is what causes people to dismiss it so quickly. Not that I disagree with anything you said. But I think it's very important to look at the situation more deeply and more systemically, rather than just as how people respond to actual rape.

The other day in my class (I teach middle school) one of my boys was about fight another one of my boys because the other boy asked his girlfriend to go out with him. ""She's mine, and he's trying to take her from me"". Never once did he think to ask his girlfriend ""Do you like him? Would you leave me to date him?"" or to even consider that she had agency in the situation or that her feelings or preferences mattered. In his mind, she was a commodity that another boy could just come over and take. *That* is a symptom of rape culture, as well. Women are things you enjoy, not people you talk to. Women are things to have sex with, and it doesn't matter what *their* desires are because they don't have emotions - they're there for me, they're mine.

I actually watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko) today, which is another great example of how rape culture is so much more than just blaming the victim. Part of rape culture includes the ""fact"" that boys can't be raped. It's the same part of rape culture that dismiss men who make offensive comments to women as ""just acting on instinct"", as if men are generally incapable of controlling how they act on their desires. ""Men will be men,"" people will say after a woman ""bitches"" about how she is getting cat-called. ""Don't wear such a low-cut shirt; men can't help themselves when they see a pretty woman.""

Rape culture isn't just blaming the victim of an actual rape.

"Are you **actually** trying to say because 14 and 15 year old boys believe something this is indicative of **societies**. 

If there was a worse anecdotal evidence award, you'd receive it.

a) You've decided, without investigation, based on a presumed bias that he thought, a process you decided without any investigation that he had: not consulted his girlfriend; thought she was a commodity; disregarded her agency.

b) You are using a **single** example, a single example of a fight between two 14 - 15 year old boys no less. Boys who are going through some of there most formative sexual development years. The way you speak you may as well be a young earth creationist. At 14, 15 I'm pretty sure you can't decide that these guys will go on to be objectifying misogynist, there brains are swimming in hormones.

c) Could perhaps be that a middle schooler doesn't have the cognative reasoning to eloquently explain instead of ""She's mine, and he's trying to take her from me"" he perhaps meant to say ""She's my girlfriend, and he's trying to take her away me despite knowing we are in a relationship, He is doing this with little to no respect for our relationship, and as such I would like to physical accost him out of a feeling of disrespect he has displayed to me, as well as making me question the loyalty my girlfriend has to me without merit"". My interpretation is just as much unfounded conjecture as yours, yet suddenly you can take a whole different meaning that this self-repeated self-confirming dogmatic circle of rape culture claims.

d) Rape culture has nothing to do with boy being raped, this is just a shoe horned in addition to try and make 'allies'. I'm a male cis rape victim. The latest rape culture crusade has done nothing but marginalize me and my experience. When you imply that I am a rapist or rape support by not jumping on the bandwagon you are in the act of victim blaming. Rape culture feminist often claim male and rapist are pretty indistinguishable.

Of course that true. And, lacking the appropriate cognitive reasoning, they go along with what they have been taught and what they have internalized. They don't have the cognitive reasoning to question the way they've been taught to view women.

It certainly does. Rape culture is about how we, as a culture, respond to rape. There is nothing about rape culture that should exclude male rape victims, or any time of victims of rape for that matter.

&gt; implying sexist action are 'rape culture' to me, a victim of rape, is dismissive of what rape is. How dare you claim some guy being sexist is the same as the forceful sexual violation I experienced. 

I never did that. I simply recommended that a discussion of ""rape culture"" needs to include a discussion of more than just the actual act of rape. Rape culture encompasses more than just the action of rape - it includes the dehumanization of the sexual partner that is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for rape. It includes the dismissal of an entire class of rape victims as ""impossible"". It includes the mindset of possession within relationships and the extension that sex with my partner is mine to take.

citation needed on those broad claims. Yes discrimination happens, you've provided no unbias, uncircular evidence to prove it's an issue and not just 'something that happens to some people'. Nor have you proven an insurgence or homoeostasis, or even existence of a culture that actively dehumanization/objectification women for the purpose of rape.

The point I was making was you were using anecdotal evidence with the purpose of supporting an argument conclusion. You can't start with a conclusion and get your evidence after the fact, this results in cherry picking.

&gt; Of course that true. And, lacking the appropriate cognitive reasoning, they go along with what they have been taught and what they have internalized. They don't have the cognitive reasoning to question the way they've been taught to view women.

Do you teach them that women are less than human? Do you think their father teach them? Mothers? Who is this imaginary force that is teaching them women are less than human. Point to them. Argumentum ad populum: just because people say it is doesn't make it a thing.

&gt; It certainly does. Rape culture is about how we, as a culture, respond to rape. There is nothing about rape culture that should exclude male rape victims, or any time of victims of rape for that matter.

You are replying to a premise without replying to the point I made. Please address the point I made.

Rape culture is -- from where I stand -- a witch hunt in the same vein as thinking all male primary teachers are pedophiles.

&gt; When did I imply you were a rapist? Also, I don't know what you meant ""when you imply that I am ... rape support"". Can you clarify that sentence?

Let me clarify, ""You"" being me colloquially referring to the party I am talking about, in this case ""[large portion of vocal] rape culture activists"", not you in particular, apologies for the confusion there.

&gt; Did I do that? If I did, I apologize because that was certainly not my intent, and I'd appreciate it if you point where I did so I can clarify. If I didn't, can we keep this one on topic?

refer to above. I'm sure it's not the objective of rape culture advocates to imply, I, a victim of rape is by gender a rapist. This however is the net sum result.

&gt; I never did that. I simply recommended that a discussion of ""rape culture"" needs to include a discussion of more than just the actual act of rape. Rape culture encompasses more than just the action of rape - it includes the dehumanization of the sexual partner that is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for rape.

It includes the shame involved with not following specific gender roles, including the gender role that men like sex and thus can't be raped. All of this is part of rape culture, whether you as a rape victim like that or not.

Most of what was said has nothing to do with rape. The smallest component is actually 'rape'. It has to do with interpersonal relationships.

You know why it's called rape culture, and not 'negative interpersonal relationship culture', because rape is taboo and gimmicky. Rape culture and the witch hunt it has become trivializes rape, and instills a culture of fear and guilt where there shouldn't be one.

"Maybe you hang around incredibly shitty people. I have never heard people say that someone deserved to be raped or heard people brag about sleeping with blackout girls. 

Saying that these incredibly isolated incidences are indicative of ""rape culture"" is as correct as me saying that nazi culture is a large problem in the US. 

Also what institutions protect them?

Rape is an incredibly difficult case to judge because it is so often he said she said, and because we don't jail people if there is a hint of doubt the accused often goes free. 

But this is not in place to protect rapists, but everyone. If we just jailed everyone accused of rape then it would be far to easy to jail people you dislike.

"&gt; The other part of rape culture is where it is acceptable to casually violate consent. In the pickup scene there are techniques to get around ""last minute resistance"".

To claim that this has anything to do with violating consent and rape culture is absurd.

It's about the exact opposite - getting full consent and making her comfortable.

""Last minute resistance"" is in most cases a result of slut-shaming, where the woman in question obviously for the most part want sex, but is afraid of ""being a slut"".

"&gt;The number of times I've actually heard someone explicitly say, in response to a news story about rape, that the victim deserved it...

I don't think this is common or acceptable at all. If someone were to say that they would probably get shut down really hard for saying something so disrespectful. I don't think I've ever seen someone say that without getting instantly swarmed with people telling them how wrong they are. The only circumstance where I can see this happening is when a criminal gets raped in prison. While it's still not acceptable to say they ""deserved it"" in that circumstance, you have to understand that people say things they probably shouldn't when they get fired up. When Ariel Castro committed suicide in prison my first thought was ""good riddance that sick fuck is gone."" I don't actually condone committing suicide and looking back on it, it really is a fucked up thing to wish upon anybody. Hell, I've told my brother to go get hit by a car when I was mad at him. But obviously I don't actually want him to do that. It's hard for me to put this thought into words so I hope you get the point I'm making. Basically, people who say prisoners ""deserved"" rape are often just worked up and don't actually condone it. I also think this issue more or less has to do with the general populous' disconnect and lack of empathy for prisoners, rather than ""rape culture."" 

&gt;In the pickup scene there are techniques to get around ""last minute resistance"". 

Never heard of this, care to elaborate?

&gt;Guys in college joke about having sex with blacked out chicks (the implication being that they're specifically doing it to get around informed consent) or even specifically drugging them.

This is like saying anybody who's made a joke about 9/11 is condoning terrorism. Yeah, it's a fucked up thing to joke about rape but it doesn't imply anybody making the jokes is condoning rape or encouraging it. It's just dark humor. It will offend people, it will make others laugh. But the bottom of the line is humor is not meant to be taken as a judgement of character."	cl7v2tv	t1_cl7g94l	pwntpants	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;  In the pickup scene there are techniques to get around ""last minute resistance"".

If you're trying to show that rape is a culturally accepted thing, you might want to find a better example than pick-up artists. I don't think I've ever seen someone who wasn't themselves a PUA refer to them with anything except contempt.

&gt;On top of that, entire institutions will protect rapists if they are stars at sports, as an example.

That's true. But sports stars and celebrities are also given a pass on other crimes, and men who aren't sports stars or celebrities aren't given a pass on rape. So it seems to me that's evidence of celebrity worship, not rape culture."	cl7q75y	t1_cl7g94l	atrasicarius	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Well first of all feminism does not hate men. I am a man and a feminist so, there you go.

"This is really not a helpful response. You're wearing quite a chip on your shoulder here and it's not helping your argument. Terms like Feminist Inquisition and sarcastic tone aren't useful discussion tools.

Yes, false rape accusations happen, but the rate of them vs. actual rapes or underreported rapes is [unknowable](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-19/how-many-rape-reports-are-false). We do know that rape and sexual assault frequently goes underreported so the people who care very much about these things err on the side of the victims. Marital rape wasn't made illegal in the US until 1995, there are still plenty of people who grew up in the world where husbands could rape their wives with impunity.

&gt; Agreed. If these women can walk away at any time, then they have consented to sex. Regret cannot retroactively recall consent. 

How does that apply to what you're responding to? Consent can absolutely be withdrawn during a sex act, which is what /u/lolbifrons was referring to. Breaking through ""Last minute resistance"" is still rape. No one mentioned withdrawing consent after the fact.

&gt; Go back to Grad School, not even the true believers will believe that one. 

Smells like an ad hominem. If you'd like an actual example, twitter's been flooded the past few weeks with people who say Jennifer Lawrence shouldn't have taken nude photos of herself in the first place, as if it's her fault someone stole her property.

&gt; We have a Inquisition Culture, run by psychopaths to attack the innocent. But their time will end soon, and we, the innocents, will be without them. 

No idea what you're talking about here. But no movement is perfect, people are flawed, sometimes bad things happen and we should always be wary of this. But here in the glorious west, we are incredibly lucky to be living in one of the few places in the world during the brief window of time where a woman has any legal ability to seek redress for sex crimes. The majority of the world and the entirety of history didn't have this ability. We're only just barely coming into a world of gender equality and there's still work to be done. If you want to characterize this change as some kind of inquisition, I think that's just unfair."	cl7l15z	t1_cl7je0t	Wazula42	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists.

"&gt; Moderating the debate only makes me accountable to oppression in the first place; the entire point of my tone is to show that I don't need the approval of Feminism to think. 

I have no idea what you're talking about. Sarcastic tone only proves that you're unwilling to engage fully in a discussion.

&gt; Full stop. Rape accusations are unknowable, therefore men should be presume guilty? What? What are you implying? 

I didn't say that. I said we don't know how many rape accusations are false, but we know it's far less than actual rapes, and we know that actual rapes go underreported, and should be taken seriously.

&gt; Don't act like this isn't true.

While I absolutely believe sex scandals are always overblown and should be handled personally, it's a different story public officials and politicians. These people work for us, they work for you and me because we pay their salaries with our taxes. We're allowed to express disapproval with their behavior, and moreover, videos and pictures sent to other people for the purpose of harassing or aggressively flirting with them are a different story than private images from a private individual intended for private dissemination.

&gt; Of course, and I should be ever grateful to have my rights taken so that others may have them.

I really don't think I'll be able to change your opinion but I'm just going to say that, while divorce and marriage are complicated institutions with a lot of gendered components to them, it's really not on the same order of magnitude as not being able to vote or seek redress for repeated sexual assault. It is a major issue, absolutely, but feminism was born out of the desire for women to be seen as *human beings*. That's where it cut its teeth. Fighting against the subhuman status of females. I'm also going to point out that, while biases probably exist in the divorce court against men, there's really no legal ban on you getting divorced or getting married, whereas historically and globally for women, neither option has been a choice.	cl7zzv1	t1_cl7vhtg	Wazula42	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; Oh yes, because Women are children, and are incapable of practicing responsibility.

Aaaaaaand here we go.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case[1]

Oh. Huh. One case? Here's an opposing [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston#Sexual_assault_complaint), I'd like to highlight this part:

&gt; Though a medical examination of the victim revealed injuries consistent with sexual trauma – including bruises and semen – and the victim would later identify Winston by name as her attacker, Tallahassee police reportedly never obtained a DNA sample from Winston, never interviewed him, nor attempted to obtain video of the alleged assault taken by Seminoles teammate Chris Casher. The investigation was conducted by Officer Scott Angulo, who, the Times' article notes, did private security work for the Seminole Boosters, the primary financier of Florida State athletics.

Would you imagine that? Someone who worked for the Boosters helped get the Heisman Trophy shoe-in (later winner) off because of a botched investigation. Well I never!

I couldn't imagine an institution hiding misdeeds their athletes or staff have committed. *cough* Sandusky *cough*

And for the one you provided, how many do you think are being kept quiet and dealt with internally to ensure that nothing gets out to prevent a tarnished reputation?

&gt; Full Stop. What does consent mean? The right to say No.

No. Consent is expressed permission or agreement given for an action. It has nothing to do with ""rights,"" it has to do with allowance. In essence, ""I am giving you my explicit consent to have sex with me."" It's not a constant either. One of the biggest issues, actually. It can be revoked at anytime.

&gt; If these women can walk away at any time, then they have consented to sex. Regret cannot retroactively recall consent.

No one is talking about regretting an ONS?

&gt; Go back to Grad School, not even the true believers will believe that one.

What is a *true believer?* But here you [go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case#Public_reaction).

Even the **media** was out to blame this girl for going and getting herself raped.

&gt; And what about the innocents who are trapped under the crossfire of the Feminist Inquisition?

Oh goodness! Do false accusations suck? Fuck yeah they do. Unfortunately the only institution you have to blame for false accusations being an issue would be the Justice Department. The judicial system is the issue, not rape victims or groups that attempt to support rape victims.

&gt; But their time will end soon, and we, the innocents, will be without them.

"Rape culture just means that our culture encourages men to partake in and excuse rape and rape like behavior. For some reason, our culture encourages women not to have sex and invest some of their self worth in their chastity, while simultaneously putting a lot of pressure on men to have sex and invest some of their self worth in being able to get women to have sex with them.

This leads to all sorts of unhealthy behavior.

For example there is a common and accepted practice of giving a woman alcohol until she will consent to sex that she wouldn't have sober but not enough alcohol to make it sexual assault. Using alcohol to get as close as you can to the line between sex and rape should not be acceptable, but in our culture where women feel they have to consume alcohol to get over their hangups about sex and men feeling a lot of pressure to have sex, it's a common and accepted practice.

Before you get defensive, keep in mind this is a cultural problem. Men don't have meetings where we decide that we're going to do some raping and call victims liars. All genders participate in and perpetuate rape culture.

As far as victim blaming goes, the biggest difference between rape and getting your phone stolen is that nobody would say ""you didn't keep it in your pocket, so obviously you didn't care about it. Are you sure you just didn't give it to the guy as a gift and woke up the next day regretting your decision so you decided to accuse the guy of theft?"""	cl7gtzn	t3_2j196u	cold08	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;Rape culture just means that our culture encourages men to partake in and excuse rape and rape like behavior.

Yes, a culture that views rape as basically second on a list of ""worst crimes"" certainly sounds like on that ""encourages and excuses"" rape. 

&gt;For example there is a common and accepted practice of giving a woman alcohol until she will consent to sex that she wouldn't have sober but not enough alcohol to make it sexual assault. 

That woman is drinking alcohol willingly. I don't see the problem, she is (or ought to be) completely capable of making her own decisions, whether sober or drunk. Alcohol isn't some sort of wonder-drug that can be administered to people surreptitiously and that causes them to answer ""yes"" to any question asked. It's a fairly foul-tasting liquid depressant (as far as drugs go) that lowers inhibitions.

&gt;As far as victim blaming goes, the biggest difference between rape and getting your phone stolen is that nobody would say ""you didn't keep it in your pocket, so obviously you didn't care about it. Are you sure you just didn't give it to the guy as a gift and woke up the next day regretting your decision so you decided to accuse the guy of theft?""

Bullshit. People say stuff like that all the time, **particularly** in response to pick-pocketing, theft, burglary, and so on. Just think of all the advice tourists and such get on how to avoid pick-pocketing. Apply that to rape, and it's ""victim blaming"".

"I feel like everyone with this thought has this need to argue because we are talking about women exclusively. This isn't just about women.

I have heard countless people in my life, and I have lived all over the USA, where people will joke about men going into a ""pound me in the ass prison"". People don't say that as a joke. People really like knowing people get raped in jail. They view it as part of the punishment. We joke about men raping each other so much when it actually happens they are afraid to speak up about it.

"&gt; No one would argue with that usage.

Uh... actually I would argue that systematic rape of people in prison is a bad thing. Not only are some people who end up in prison innocent, but ""punitive"" prison practices are not a good way to rehabilitate someone. Unless you want to keep them in prison forever and foot the bill, further psychologically damaging someone as a prisoner just seems like asking for even more trouble down the road. I mean, Jesus, we look back on Roman gladiatorial fights as horrific and see hanging people from crosses to die in the sun as barbaric. Is locking people in cages to have them raped somehow better???

This is precisely what we mean when we talk about a culture of rape. 

edit: Ah, I may have misread this or maybe it's been edited to be clearer. In either case, I think it's a bit disingenuous to swap the shoe to the other foot and say ""ok, this rape culture is real and ""bad"" in prison, but in our regular society it's overstated."" I mean, there are totally reasonable precautions that can be taken to avoid going into prison. I don't think that justifies prison rape. Likewise, dismissing ""pushiness,"" ""advice"" given to victims about how they could have prevented the rape, etc. is equally as silly and insensitive. 

I also recognize this take on things from MRA, who point out the rate rape has in prison as a huge problem that's overlooked (I agree that it is a terrible problem and should be dealt with instead of ignored) while downplaying the real struggles of women as basically ""whining."" That may not be the intention here, but sexual assault and rape are *not* an us vs. them problem. I'm sure there are crazy radical feminists who think we should ignore sex crimes against men for some reason because women have more problems, but it makes much more sense to me to tackle these issues as a whole society - which is why I think talking about the ""rape culture"" is important to begin with.

I'd just like to add that by far the most common sexual use of alcohol that I see is to lower the inhibitions of both people. And removing the agency of every woman who decides to drink and then have sex is infantilizing them. But, there are sleazy, predatory people (mostly guys) who use alcohol, lies, pushiness, and manipulation to get near-comatose girls to fuck them. And that's immoral. Still in the minority of alcohol cases, though.	cl7m3k8	t1_cl7l7y7	CaptainDexterMorgan	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Well, firstly, we're not discussing actions committed by a drunk person, were discussing the actions of those around the drunk person(s).

However, I was under the impression that in many cases alcohol related crimes called into question mens rea and made intent questionable, and that's why drunk drivers tend to be charged with vehicular manslaughter instead of murder due to the fact that the crime isn't a felony due to negligence.

You're not, but your very own argument contradicts your point: yes, intent to kill is often not present, but merely being drunk does not magically remove intent.

You said this. I said that it impairs judgement *as well*. Lowering inhibitions isn't the only issue. Also, your statements were contradictory.

&gt; A drunk person is completely capable of committing murder, but killing someone in what is legitimately an accident is not murder.

Is it an accident? Maybe, it was a preventable one, that's why it's negligence.

But again, you're conflating the discussion. Your position is regarding the person who is drunk, whatever, the person is drunk. The crime of rape happens when someone outside of the drunk person takes advantage of that person, in any way.

"&gt; A drunk person, with lowered inhibitions and impaired judgement (which are basically the same thing) is completely capable of granting informed consent (otherwise you'd be able to get out of a loan by signing for it piss-drunk). 

I recently got my marriage license and part of the oath was to declare that you weren't drunk or under the influence of any intoxicating substances. Being inebriated can invalidate legal contracts, not just marriage licenses.

I don't know what your experiences with alcohol are, but they sound pretty limited; people who do things all the time under the influence that they would never do while while drunk. They get in fights, jump off of buildings, walk into traffic, etc. It also inhibits motor control, making people unable to resist advances or even form coherent sentences, either saying yes or no. 

Being very drunk also inhibits your ability to form long term memories (blacking out), making it a date rape drug. If you rape someone who is very drunk and they black out afterwards, they won't remember the rape.  

You could be at a party and a horribly drunk person falls in your arms. You think they are coming on to you, right? You ask if they want to have sex, they mumble something. What did they say? You fondle them and they don't respond (they didn't feel it). So you have sex with them (rape them), and then they black out, and the next day they have no memory.

"Weird, why would you intentionally want to sound like a tool? I think that pointing that out makes me look like someone who wants fewer tools to be tools in debates.

&gt; Or it's because rape is something that ""only"" happens to men and women must be babied and handled with velvet gloves.

I'm guessing you meant ""women"", not ""men"" there, so I'll argue off of that:

Are you actually claiming that rape gets treated as a more sensitive issue because it happens more to females, rather than because it is emotionally scarring? So, when your shit gets stolen, that is absolutely horrible. You might be emotional, you might worry about your finances, etc. But when it comes down to it, that's all just *stuff*. It has nothing to do with you personally.

When you get raped, your entire being is violated. Your body is used in *the single most intimate way that a body can be used*, in a way that most only reserve for people whom they trust. At some point, we have a firewall protecting that, saying ""I will only let people whom I trust past this firewall."" So when someone breaches that, it makes you question *everything*. People launch into deep depressions (as was the case for my only friend who has been raped). They doubt their ownership of their bodies, and what makes them who they are. That is fucked up on the deepest level.

So let's not make this about ""We only care about rape because we feel like we have to treat women nice"". To do so is an unbelievable insult to those who have been through this."	cl80p42	t1_cl80fa1	crayZsaaron	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; Yes, a culture that views rape as basically second on a list of ""worst crimes"" certainly sounds like on that ""encourages and excuses"" rape.

We have a culture where male victims are basically ignored, because ""men are always up for it anyway, and how could a woman overpower a man and rape him? Impossible, women can't rape men."" We have a culture where female victims are told ""it's your own fault for dressing like a tart and getting drunk"" and ""you're probably just crying 'rape' because you regret giving it away, slut."" 

We do also condemn proven rapists, but before we do that we look for any reason to claim that 'it wasn't really rape'. So, we most certainly do live in a culture where rape is often excused, and by excusing it we also encourage it. When you teach people that certain kinds of rape 'aren't really rape' it becomes more likely that they'll go and do it because they've learned that they aren't doing anything wrong.

"&gt; Yes, a culture that views rape as basically second on a list of ""worst crimes"" certainly sounds like on that ""encourages and excuses"" rape.

You say it doesn't excuse rape and then give this rationalization

&gt;That woman is drinking alcohol willingly. I don't see the problem, she is (or ought to be) completely capable of making her own decisions, whether sober or drunk. Alcohol isn't some sort of wonder-drug that can be administered to people surreptitiously and that causes them to answer ""yes"" to any question asked. It's a fairly foul-tasting liquid depressant (as far as drugs go) that lowers inhibitions.

to excuse the other person of any responsibility of participating in our custom where a guy gives a girl alcohol until her inhibitions are low enough that she'll sleep with him. You're excusing the guy by saying ""she knew what she was doing when she accepted the drinks.""

&gt;Bullshit. People say stuff like that all the time, particularly in response to pick-pocketing, theft, burglary, and so on. Just think of all the advice tourists and such get on how to avoid pick-pocketing. Apply that to rape, and it's ""victim blaming"". QED.

As per the OP's story, is family made fun of him by telling him he should have put his phone in his pocket. That is victim blaming, and if that had happened to me they might get an ""I know, fuck off.""

What his family didn't do is say ""Are you sure you just didn't give it to him as a gift? I mean everyone saw you sitting there with it out on the table. Are you going to ruin this guy's life by calling him a thief even though it looks like you gave it to him of your own free will and just regret it now?"""	cl7mcyz	t1_cl7l7y7	cold08	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Not a true strawman, in my opinion, although /u/cold08's argument there is a little bit dramatic. Although conversations using exactly similar words to those probably happen veeery rarely in rape cases, the derived meaning of people's responses can be similar to ""I mean everyone saw you sitting there with it out on the table"". 

To provide a single example (anecdotal evidence should be valid for an example in this case), the single person that I know who was raped had to answer many times the ""what were you wearing"" question, which has an implied meaning that is obviously quite similar to the ""everyone saw you etc."" statement."	cl80hrq	t1_cl7modf	crayZsaaron	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists.

First, it's not just about the rapist, it's about the victim. Also note that your statement only applies for a very specific subset of rape, violent stranger rape. Anything other than violent rape becomes far harder to prosecute mainly because people tend to have a view that favors the rapist.

&gt;Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. 

Not always. Often the ""advice"" borders on doubting whether a rape even happened. Look at any girl assaulted while at a college party. The ""rape culture"" which seeks to find what the woman did to deserve it gets in the way of the conviction or condemnation of the rapist.

&gt;Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket.

Look, there is a difference between victim blaming and honest advice giving. The difference is when the tone shifts from, how to prevent, to ""you deserved it"". Unfortunately, the tone tends to be more on the latter camp.

You have touched on an interesting part of this topic, that I feel has been missed out. Essentially it is the abhorrently low conviction rate of rapists. However, this is where you are making the mistake, it is not because society favors the rapist. It is due to that rape is almost exclusively done in private without witness and evidence is hard to obtain. I can only speak of the Scottish legal system but there has been great efforts to try negate this. Judges have found ways around what was considered foundation points of law to accommodate and convict, who they believe to be, rapists. Legislation has been put up to protect rape victims from question (which is required in an adversarial system). The problem is not societies view causing this low conviction rate. It is that we believe, rightly, that crimes must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A he said she said scenario which most rape cases are is almost impossible to convict on. Just a side note it is important for people to understand that the vast majority of rape cases are acquaintance rape. In other words the victim and the perpetrator know each other (i should note here this does not make it worse or better in nay respect but it is worth noting) this idea of a man in the bushes is vastly mistaken.	cl7ivh5	t1_cl7hdyj	studentlad	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

California's new consent law is exactly the kind of steps you're talking about to increase rape convictions.  The problem is in order to do this we must basically assume people are guilty and they have to prove their innocence which is not how the legal system should work.

"&gt;Once a rape case reaches the courts, almost 60 per cent of defendants are convicted – a rate higher than some other violent attacks.

#

&gt;Once a rape case reaches the courts

There's the problem. Once it reaches the courts. They don't always, or even often, reach the courts.

You can't look at a tiny subsection of the relevant information and proclaim victory.

The article you link cites [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7442785/Rape-conviction-rate-figures-misleading.html) where I got that quote from. But let's scroll down a bit further, shall we?

&gt;Other findings in her wide-ranging report include: [...] nine in ten rapes go unreported

So almost 60% of those that get to court get convicted. But only 10% of them get reported in the first place. Let's go visit Magical Christmas Land for a while and assume that every single rape that gets reported goes to court. That's still only a *six percent conviction rate*. Six fucking percent. And that's ignoring everything that happens between a report and going to court!

The conviction rates of rape are so impossibly low they might as well be non-existent.

Let's scroll down even further.

&gt;but with less than seven per cent of reported rapes leading to a successful prosecution

*LESS THAN SEVEN PERCENT OF REPORTED RAPES*. So with 60% of cases that go to court turn into convictions, that's, what, 12% of reported cases that go to court?

So while reporting it is obviously the first step; there's clearly some problems happening half way through if only 1 in 8 go to court.

"I wouldn't necessarily say so. IANAL, but from what I understand of law, the case will (generally) only go to court if the prosecuting attorney believes that there's enough evidence to reasonably end with a conviction (otherwise, they'd just be wasting everyone's time and money).

As terrible of a crime as rape is, the justice system is and must always be based on 'innocent until proven guilty'. And it is very very very very VERY hard to prove the absence of consent in many cases. So the only options for those cases are to reject the concept of innocent until proven guilty and have the defendant have to prove their own innocence above all else, take the case to court knowing that you'll lose and waste time and money, or continue as things are and not let the case go to court."	cl81zs2	t1_cl81wtl	starlitepony	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

Using your definition of conviction rate, the general crime conviction rate is 7.5%. Obviously 6% is worse, but it's a difference of small degree, not the massive degree you pretend it is. More convictions can be obtained by increasing reporting (and it seriously comes off like you're blaming the legal system for not magically knowing about cases that aren't brought to their attention) than fixing that small difference.	cl8g1t3	t1_cl7sf0u	XXCoreIII	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Thank you. I'm a guy and got sexually assaulted and had to deal with the same stuff you're describing. Even rather sympathetic friends expressed doubt about parts of my story or that a guy could even end up in a sexual situation that he was uncomfortable with / not enjoying. The thoughts that go through your mind, especially when the perpetrator is someone your friends or family knows, are difficult to deal with and there's always doubt. 

I mean, to the guys or doubters in the thread - imagine one of your guys friends approached you to tell you a cute female friend sexually assaulted him. Maybe he was really drunk and said he wasn't up for sex and she started berating him and groping him. Maybe he woke up to find her ""playing"" with him while he was asleep and he was really creeped out about it. What are your reactions? Do you wonder why he wouldn't be pleased that she wanted to have sex with him? Do you think his story seems a little odd?

It's never OK for people to feel like you owe them sex or that ""getting a little carried away"" isn't a big deal. Getting touched by other people that aren't family or close friends isn't all that common in our culture. It can be really upsetting when it gets creepy.

"&gt;  Anything other than violent rape becomes far harder to prosecute mainly because people tend to have a view that favors the rapist.

Do you have any evidence for this claim?

It seems plausible that non-violent rape is intrinsically difficult to persecute because the trial typically becomes a ""he said, she said"" situation where the accuser claims that there was a nonconsensual sex intercourse, while the defendant claims that intercourse happened but was consensual, and there are no witnesses or physical evidence that can helpt to tell which claim is true.

Since criminal courts hold the defendant ""innocent until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt"", when there are just conflicting claims and the evidence is inconclusive, they are supposed to acquit the defendant.

"There is a pervasive idea that other forms of rape aren't ""really rape"".

I suppose I would be more likely to be falsely accused of rape than to actually be raped, so I've always been a bit wary of witch hunting.

Okay, so a serious question here. Isn't it probably right to ask what made the someone the rapists target? The more we know, the more we can do for the future, but if asking what an individual was doing that night that ended in his or her rape is perpetuation rape culture, how can we protect ourselves down the road?

"How many people have to display a behavior before it's a culture?

I don't think there's a good answer. On both sides of the argument, framing the discussion as a question of whether or not we live in a rape culture is problematic because ""culture"" is not as unified an entity we might think.

I never encountered anyone in college or elsewhere who indicated they believed sex without clear consent was okay. Then again, I went to a private Christian college: a self-selected environment with its own attitudes. When people say that the people *they* know at *their* college have a different attitude, I take their word for it.

I don't believe rape culture exists on pervasive, publically-approved scale, just like I wouldn't say we live in a murder culture or theft culture; nevertheless there are people and groups of people who privately condone such crimes."	cl7jdzr	t3_2j196u	PoeCollector	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Not all ""advice"" is created equal. There's a big difference between say, criticising your son for grazing his knee when he ignored your warnings and skateboarded too aggressively, and criticising someone's else son who looked both ways before crossing the road but got hospitalised by a reckless driver anyway. Most people would consider the former to be reasonable parenting, most people would consider the latter to be extremely insensitive, nosy and just wrong. 

Why? In the former case, the injury was minor, the victim was reckless and the relationship between you was close. In the latter case, the injury was major, the victim did nothing wrong (unless you consider daring to cross a road as being wrong) and the relationship between you was distant. 

What's this got to do with rape? Well, quite a bit of ""advice"" is quite similar to my latter example. If someone has been raped, then it's been a very traumatic time for them, so even well-meaning advice is insensitive at best. Secondly, a lot of the criticised behaviour is hardly reckless if at all - wearing revealing clothing, for instance, is a far cry from throwing yourself into a cage of starving lions. Finally, it's usually from a stranger, and we don't like strangers telling us off in a way that we might tolerate from our parents.

I notice you seem to agree somewhat with this sentiment anyway, but here's my attempt in trying to draw a line for where ""helpful advice"" ends."	cl7wtla	t3_2j196u	honeypuppy	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Rape just seems to be the hot topic of the generation. Most decent people in this world acknowledge that rape is bad and should be punished, and the people that think it's ok to rape won't have their opinions changed by simply telling them ""you're making rape culture stick around!"". In this world there must be victims and there must be criminals. Wether it's the victim of a sex crime or a war. 

We do everything we can to stop rape by shaming it and similar sexual acts and by punishing the ones who partake in them. The idea that we can stop rape is as idealistic as the idea that we can stop war. No matter what we do, someone will always be born with a wire missing who acts on urges that most normal people know not to. For the same reason that some people murder. 

You can shout and tell them how wrong they are but some people just don't care. We arrest them and let them rot in prison. What else is there to do about rapist? I see people constantly say they need to be stopped and we need to destroy rape culture but no one says how. You can't just erase things in our world. Someone will always be there to take part in things we hate. People are too different to try and change them on such a large scale. 

It's sad we live in a world where women need to be scared to walk alone at night, but that doesn't mean we can just fix it. The number of people who rape and murder is very small compared to the worlds population.. Keep in mind the few people who do these things DECIDED to. You guys/girls know as well as me that it's hard enough to change one persons opinion, much more so when you're trying to change people with extreme beliefs (such as rape is ok). All of this energy devoted to screaming at rape culture could be devoted to teaching personal safety classes, or writing articles about analyzing red flags of a sexual predator.

""You guys is fuckin' up ya know? Maybe you should stop raping those people."" 

It doesn't really work. I'm all for action.
I don't go around saying rape culture needs to be destroyed and rape is bad because I believe when people say that they're just trying to change the opinions of rapist/rape supporters. I know that people who support rape are there, and I prefer to ignore them, because honestly they aren't making any advances in the way rape is looked at.

"We joke about it because it's ironic that someone who would rape would be at the other side of the situation. I only ever condone that humor around me if it's about a rapist, murderer, or child molestor. It's a consequence of action. We can't govern the way prisoners handle each other anymore than we can the people in other countries. Sometimes people use it as a deterrent. They'll tell you unless you wanna end up being some guys bitch in the slammer you'll straighten up. That's hardly victim shaming or anything of the sort. It's making light of the morbid in this world. I hear 9/11 jokes weekly. I hear dead baby jokes all the time. It's not ok to censor the way people speak because others take it more seriously. Their argument, ""my friend joked about it"" won't be taken seriously by anyone. It's just another excuse.

That's not victim blaming.

&gt;Like that's the kind of world we should just accept. Like rape is just a natural consequence of being a woman.

There's nothing we can do to completely eliminate all shittiness in the world. Yes, we should try, but rape is a natural consequence of being a person, same as theft, murder, etc.

&gt;it's a lack of understanding about consent that's the cause behind acquaintance rape being so common.

"The converse attitude is the extreme of hypoagency combined with entitlement.   ""Harmful"" is the idea that when a crime against an individual is committed,  ""society"" is to blame, or that ""the culture"" condones it.  

Harmful is taking a societal problem, and then saying a class of people are responsible for causing it.

You just proved yourself wrong. Since when is the definition of rape between just a man and a woman? The very fact that we have even more of an issue dealing with rape and men proves your entire point wrong by your own logic. According to you, society abhors rape unless the victim is a man. Which mean society does not completely abhor rape, and you are right.

"When I hear the phrase ""rape culture"" what it is commonly associated with is India (and perhaps other developing countries). 

I have heard about [several instances] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/07/15/331347739/why-a-village-leader-ordered-the-rape-of-a-14-year-old-in-india) when a young girl is raped in India but the rapist is not convicted or punished in any way. That is the real issue that the phrase ""rape culture"" is trying to deal with, the inequality of women in developing and 3rd world countries.

I want to say I agree with the idea that in the United States and other first world countries there isn't a ""rape culture"". At worst there are the few people who blame the victims by saying things like ""you shouldn't have been wearing that"". But I believe they are the vocal minority. The same with those that claim there is a ""rape culture"" in the United States, they are part of the vocal minority.

"I really don't think you understand the meaning of 'rape culture'. When a practice is part of your culture, it's often so easy to overlook that you won't even notice when it's happened. Kind of like how racist people don't even realize when they're being racist.

Just like a racist person might complain that black people 'really don't have it that hard', you'll have men excusing poor behavior towards women- the way this CMV does- for the same reasons. What it really means, when they say that, is that they've never had to experience the repercussions of these cultural norms for themselves."	cl7rdxw	t1_cl7lx6l	321_liftoff	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I don't think rape and violence against women is a non-issue in the United States. It is happening in the United States at tragically high rates and I believe rape and violence against not just women, but anyone is despicable and should be punished.

"Honestly? I think the fact that these kind of CMVs regularly make the front page are indicative of american rape culture. I mean, why do we have to explain this kind of stuff every week or so? 

The issue with concepts such as rape culture and racism are that they are intangibles that are completely invisible until the moment something happens. You'll never know that a buddy of yours thinks all women are whores until you see him treat one in such a way, and just saying? You probably won't ever see him when he's doing such a thing. 

The fact is, most women who have been raped get told that it was their fault in some way, shape, or form by somebody. It's even an acceptable defense in court, for christ sake. If that doesn't tell you enough about the way our country works, I don't know what will.

"Your mistake is assuming that the term ""rape culture"" means an entire culture is pro-rape, and that's not what it means at all. 

I think, overall, Western culture is net anti-rape. However, that doesn't mean that there aren't aspects of our culture that contribute to rape. ""Rape culture"" is simply what we call those aspects; it does not describe an *entire* country, culture, region, race, religion, or anything else, just the aspects of any of those that cause any of the following: increased likelihood/frequency of sexual assaults, decreased conviction rates of sexual assaults, or increased suffering of sexual assault victims.

So, there are certainly parts of any culture that do those things. Prudish groups that blame the victim for the way they were dressed, religious/conservative groups that claim that it isn't rape if it's your spouse, people who tell male victims to ""man up"" and/or perpetuate the idea that men always want sex and thus can't be raped, cops who don't take victims seriously regardless of gender, constant jokes about rape as domination or retribution, churches protecting child molesting preists, schools protecting rapist athletes, crazy low conviction rates; I could go on and on.

Take, for example, the [Steubenville High School Rape Case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case). I urge you to search around and do a little reading about it. A group of football players repeatedly raped their 16 year old unconscious classmate and posted videos and jokes about it on social media. Videos of rape. Videos of all the guys at the party laughing at her being raped. The town and people all over social media jumped to their defense. They said she deserved it, they called her a slut, they lashed out at her for reporting her rapists. School faculty were indicted for trying to cover it all up. 

&gt;CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was ""Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...""

Not some crazy-ass fringe group. Motherfucking CNN put that out into the world. That's how popular that sentiment was at the time of the case.

Point is, that shit is a problem, and when we want to describe that problem, we call it ""rape culture.""

I have to disagree with this.  Violent crime is a little easier to prevent and spot than the most common forms of rape.  Also, violent crimes have a much higher prosecution rate than rape (mainly b/c it is so hard to meet the b.a.r.d. burden with rape).  Finally, and most importantly, playing video games that are violent is not the equivalent of people actually *executing the crime and get away with it*.  There aren't video games for date raping - there is actual date raping.	cl83aq6	t1_cl7ydw5	Reborn33	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"None of this seems to suggest that rape culture is particularly prevalent. Rape is, fundamentally, hard to prove as you suggest. That's not society sending the message that rape is okay, that's the result of it being hard to prove a lack on consent after the fact.


&gt;There aren't video games for date raping - there is actual date raping.


There is *plenty* of murder, assault, theft, ect. Not ""date theft"", but I'm not sure why you'd think that's relevant. The idea being ""-culture"" is elements of society that send a message condoning a certain crime. If there were movies, video games, books, and songs where the hero raped several people throughout the piece, would you say that's an element of rape culture? If so, then it seems apparent that most other crimes are way ahead in this regard.

"&gt;I was just saying that video games and date-raping (which is glorified in many pop culture contexts, look at Barney Stinson in HIMYM, Blurred Lines, any other fratty movie) are not the same thing 

You're conflating two things. Video games portray and glorify violence. First, I'd argue that no medium does this (to the same extent) with rape/date rape, unless there are lyrics that actually describe rape (as there are with violence). But more to the point, of course video games and actual date-rape are not comparable- one if a medium, the other is a crime. I'm making the point that one is far more ""enshrined"" than the other.

I'm not sure why you (seem to) feel that date rape is a relevant point of comparison.

&gt;you don't get to say that the presence of violent video games condones murder if you don't at least show a link between actual murder and video games.

So where is your statistical or empirical evidence linking the things you identify as ""rape culture"" with rape? Neither of the comments you link offer any such evidence. If you want to hone in on the difference in perception, then you need to show that that difference is propagated by the things you identify as rape culture, and that said differences lead to rape.

I'd throw in theft, as my Aladdin link was only partially facetious. You can throw in Disney's Robin Hood, and now you've got two heroes presented to children that are introduced as thieves- I'm not sure you can say that about any other crimes.

"&gt;Even if they were equal in severity, it doesn't mean the others are somehow no longer significant.

I'd argue that's precisely what it means. Having a ""culture"" to go along with a crime is not significant if all of the major crimes have one of similar magnitude. If the culture surrounding sex crimes is somehow ""significant"", then that ""culture"" should somehow set them apart from the ""culture"" of other crimes.

Significant is a relative term- there's no way to see how significant one thing is without comparing it to something else.

&gt;Your argument doesn't hold up - to return to my earlier analogy, you're using skinned elbow ""arm injuries"" to argue that broken ulna ""arm injuries"" are not significant.

I'd argue that all of those, with the probable exception of vandalism (although it is *actually* glorified) are no less severe than rape culture in terms of the encouragement offered by society. Compare the number of film or video game heroes committing murder, theft, being corrupt, or doing drugs to those that commit rape (I can think of Jaime Lannister and a few Greek gods- although I'm not sure how well the 'hero' label applies here). Murder ballads are a thing in music, and theft vandalism are all over the place as well- and drugs are really in a league of their own here.

Well I don't agree with you on the severity point, but it doesn't matter. Significance of one issue still does not reduce the significance of the other. We can care about poverty and cancer at the same time. We can further adapt the analogy: a broken ulna and a broken radius are equally severe, but that does not mean that neither is important or worthy of treatment.	cl7zmfw	t1_cl7zj7m	gargravarrr	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

And I disagree. ""Condescending and smug"" is a matter of the person's intent, and while it is certainly possible that people are only offering advice to this end, many offer advice because they actually want to be helpful (and believe the advice they give will be).

"&gt;No, but I am saying that right after someone got robbed they're not thinking ""Locking my doors is a completely useless endeavor""

Actually, that probably happens, but more often when you get robbed by someone ""breaking and entering"" I'd think. Regardless, even if they were thinking that locking their doors would be useful at that immediate moment, the advice from other people will help them keep that mindset in the future.

&gt;No it's not. If I'm a business manager and I consistently hire under qualified men over qualified women, I'm sexist even if I'm not trying to keep women out of my company.

That's a false analogy. ""sexist"" the way you're using it means active discrimination against people of a particular sex: it references the *action* of discrimination, not the intent. Condescension and Smugness represent the attitude of the speaker ""I think you're and idiot but am saying it nicely"" and ""I'm better than you"" respectively. These reference the *intent*, not the actual action.

Something can come across as condescending or smug, but that doesn't mean it is.

&gt;Because you're assuming they're not competent enough to realize it themselves. Which is condescending and smug

Or that they're stressed out given that they'd just been robbed? Or maybe they've actually demonstrated that they don't realize it by saying things like ""How could this happen to me?"", ""Why me?"", or ""My security system sucks!""

"&gt;I wouldn't ever play the ""I told you so"" card on a rape victim, but if you leave valuables in an unlocked car, then I can't really have much sympathy for you if they're stolen.

So you're saying that they caused they're stuff to get robbed by leaving their door unlocked?  Or are you saying that leaving their valuables in an unlocked car actively harmed someone else and the only way to alleviate it was to steal it?  If not, why exactly are you losing sympathy for them?

&gt; Sure, hate the messenger, but we can't go through life demanding that no one hurts our feelings.

Whether or not people will do it has nothing to do with the morality of it.

Why can't we demand that no one hurts our feelings?  Why should we oppose that?

"What gets me is the inconsistency.  Let's just say for a moment that dressing sluttily causes rape.  Fine.

Now if I drove home without a seatbelt and got in a wreck, people would be like, ""You should've worn a seatbelt!"" right? 

But even if there was no wreck people would still say that.  ""Why aren't you wearing your seatbelt?""

So we can agree that with a lot of safety stuff, we tell people what they did was stupid EVEN IF NOTHING BAD CAME OF IT simply due to high risk.  Why?  Because we believe so strongly in it.  We all know seatbelts save lives.

But if I told someone I dressed a certain way, no one would tell me ""No! You could've gotten raped!""  But yet we say that about rape victims.

"&gt;If people find out you dressed a certain way and nothing bad happened, they don't tell you ""Hey! That could get you raped!""

People don't say that because it's been proven over and over again that dressing slutty doesn't make you more likely to be raped.

"&gt;Actually that's not true at all. Not wearing a seatbelt does indeed endanger other people in the vehicle, and not to a trivial degree. I've seen several accidents where someone in the car not wearing a seatbelt caused the serious injury of another.

I've never seen or heard of that happening.  But it's still not at all comparable to drunk driving.  Not wearing a seatbelt doesn't cause accidents and any injuries that may or may have have been sustained from someone else not wearing a seat belt are going to be part of a bunch of other injuries.

&gt;And I'm not really talking about the tact here in the situation

"I find this thread interesting because it's devolved into a ""who's to blame"" discussion and for that I think it misses the point. First let me state I'm not a fan of the term ""rape culture"" because it paints too many men with too broad a brush. But having said that the OP's original example of the theft of a phone actually makes a good point though not necessarily the one he meant it to. 
A phone is a object with no self determination and a thief who steals it feels entitled to possess it without regards to the legitimacy of that claim. The aspects of culture which views women with the same objectivity and treats them as tradable commodities is the culture feminist are talking about when they refer to ""rape culture."" 
Now like much of the rest of society this exists in a polarity of cultural norms, not absolutely always or absolutely never. But it is reinforced with every incident of women being treated as ""things"" to be possessed as opposed to people with entirely legitimate self determination. Rape, wife beating, even Disney princesses reinforce this view of women as ""lesser than,"" and deserves a serious redress in our culture.
In our society you have an absolute Right to enter a biker bar in pasties and a g-string; it is your right. Feigning shock at unwanted attention is simply intellectually dishonest but that doesn't mean this shouldn't change. ""Rape culture"" is a bit of an overstatement because sometimes we all actually enjoy being an object of attention, but being realistic in navigating through society as it is is not the same as discussing how it ought to be."	cl7hbyw	t3_2j196u	Seth_Crow	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

The problem is that a lot of people have difficulty wrapping their heads around the idea of a double standard.

In fairness, this distinction is a lot finer than you're making it to be. Having your phone stolen _can_ be very psychologically distressing.

"In some distant way I agree, especially if it's a physical altercation or mugging or something. On the other hand, if it's stolen off a table where you left it or something I think it's an entirely different situation. Still, I mean - if someone demands your phone and you have to hand it over that's certainly depressing and scary. If someone demands your body and ""takes it"" and uses it... I mean, how can you even compare the two? Being physically internally violated is a lot more psychotically distressing than having a piece of electronics taken away. In one case, worst case scenario you got beaten up and that's really bad. In the other case, worst case scenario is you got beaten up AND raped and maybe (in a woman's case) impregnated or infected with an STD or something. It's not really a fine distinction. One is clearly worse and different than the other, hence the different legal treatment of the crime.

"I actually think we set up a halo of special victimization around rape in ways that are not helpful. There is an assumption that because rape is an especially morally disturbing crime, rape victims must be especially traumatized. The fact is that while psychological trauma associated with rape is _different_--it's often described in a particular category, Rape Trauma Syndrome--we can't always say that it is necessarily _wprse_. 

Individual responses to traumatic events are unpredictable. You can in some cases completely break somebody simply by sending an anonymous death threat (this is a known common cause of PTSD) even though this is generally considered a lesser crime. You can trigger a major depressive episode by stealing somebody's phone if all the other conditions are there in their lives and that triggers an anxiety attack. Some people who are raped don't develop RTS. We might assign relative penalties to crimes based on what their effects are socially _believed to be_, but that doesn't mean those beliefs are correct. 

The irony is that a lot of the expectations we have about rape being especially bad are actually based on sexism. Rape is considered a serious problem in part because a.) it's a violation of a woman's chastity b.) women are considered less capable of dealing with the emotional consequences of sexuality c.) women are held responsible for managing the reactions of those around them d.) women's sexuality is seen as a problem of social control and so on and so forth. The differences in those perceptions are especially thrown intp relief when we compare the problems male rape victims face. Now, do those cultural expectations also negatively effect victims in ways that compound suffering? Absolutely. But in principle it would be better not to have them.   "	cl7ricp	t1_cl7r4v1	redwhiskeredbubul	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists.

"I think you left out one *very* important reason why rape can be so especially traumatic, which I'll try to explain: it is terrible because when a loved one tries to comfort you afterwards, you may shudder at their touch.  When your spouse leans in to kiss you, a once loving gesture makes you cringe.  If you are young when it happens, your sexual growth and development can become marred and stunted. Sex, affection, intimacy...all of these incredibly important parts of life can become intertwined with this terrible event (or series of events-as it maybe) and disrupt your ability to establish trusting, loving relationships with others.  The long term consequences, if left unchecked, can really change a person's life in a monumental way. Thank you for reading.

Because the act of thievery can't be talked about like that. I've had fraud committed and I got asked ""why did I let a dodgy person scan your credit card"", theft breaks down into sub-categories.

Most sexual assault is also perpetrated on child / teens often not surfacing til later in life.

You also go on to use examples that generalise all men and does not excuse, but tries to explain his action. Explanation =/= excuse.

"Not necessarily. But in both of those situations, the crime isn't always as it seems. Maybe the burglary victim was actually dealing drugs when he got robbed. Maybe he was taunting gangsters by flashing his Rolex and insulting them. Maybe he was passed out drunk on a park bench and a hobo grabbed his wallet. 

Or maybe he really was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and jumped by a gangster.

"I've seen girls change their minds from 'I had fun drunken sex with a guy' to 'this guy took advantage of me' after their friends tell them the guy was a loser.

There are also a fair amount of documented false rape claims. In fact, in India (recent TIL), over half of all rape claims are proven false because of the woman or her family trying to make a monetary gain off of a well-to-do man she has been with. Interesting to note - almost no rape claims are brought against poor men, who otherwise are more inclined to criminal and violent activities!

While rape is a serious crime, there are some women who make light of it.

"I'm interested if this is true. Are you talking about [these data?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics) Because I believe it leaves off many countries (read: ""Comparison of selected countries' reported rape "") and possibly has non-uniform methodology. I believe [South Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_India#Rape_statistics) has the highest rate and I'd be willing to bet there are many other countries that are higher that we don't have strong stats for due to under reporting and having little legal recourse. Like I believe the [Saudi Arabia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Saudi_Arabia) statistics are a large underestimate as a victim has strong incentive to not report it.

"&gt;First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. 

The notion of 'rape culture' doesn't mean that society literally condones and accepts rape as a normal practice. There are contexts in which this actually happens (wartime use of rape as a means of terrorizing populations, or in prisons) but it generally doesn't. 

What is does mean is that there are double standards and secondary values that produce the conditions for acquaintance rape. These standards are generally extrapolated from normative behavior, not articulated explicitly. College binge drinking is one example. While in general being _compos mentis_ is considered a good thing, we engage in practices, all the time, where we deliberately erode our own judgment and that of others with beer. Surprise, this leads to crime. Another example is that we define masculinity in terms of losing your virginity. This is paradoxical because you're making somebody's maturity and capacity to be an autonomous adult contingent on sombody else's desire to sleep with them. There's no rational solution to this expectation besides rejecting it, and it can set up situations where men are more likely to coerce women. In short, rape culture sets up coercive expectations that conflict with widely shared liberal norms about individual free will and self-determination. 

&gt;Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. 

The problem here isn't that people are being told how to manage risks but that they're often given advice on how to avoid risks that are based on misconceptions about how rape happens. The most common of these is that most rape is stranger rape. These misconceptions are based on shielding people from unsettling knowledge about how rape actually transpires--it's _easier_ to believe that most rapists are perverts hiding in the bushes since it protects you from having to suspect your friends. But the misconceptions also keep the incidence of rape high, since they're relatively useless for preventing rape.  

&gt;Of course, rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However, where's the line between helpful advice and ""rape culture?"". 

You have to be able to give a lucid, non-judgmental account of how we actually _fail_ to collectively address rape well. And we don't address it well--the lifetime incidence of rape for women is estimated between 1 in 4 and 1 in 10, which is extremely high for a serious violent crime. Now, imagine if we collectively believed as a society that most murders were perpetrated by people who were essentially serial killers, defining them as unpredictable, radically other, and demonic, and that murder was utterly unrelated, for example, to the drug trade, relative poverty, or deteriorating social conditions. Imagine if all of our crime prevention techniques were based on this principle. We'd probably have a very high murder rate, since we would have essentially given up. So too with rape.

"Just because you haven't seen it, and people don't generally say it out loud, doesn't mean it isn't a problem. Example:

I have spoken with lawyers about the generally accepted fact that prosecutors never want women on rape juries. The reason? Many women, even if they won't say it out loud, refuse to believe that rape happens to women who don't deserve it. It's easy to understand why. Juror X doesn't want to admit to herself that she could ever be raped, that she is just as vulnerable as any other woman, so she tells herself that she's smart enough, strong enough, whatever it takes, to stop it from ever happening to her. So when she is presented with a woman who was raped, she has to assume the victim is somehow responsible. Why did she trust him? Was she being provocative? Maybe she secretly wanted it. Why didn't she fight harder? And so on.

Many people carry this belief, perhaps on a subconscious level, maybe never spoken out loud. But it affects the way they think about things. Maybe ""rape culture"" is not the best term, as it may be less a ""culture"" than a result of the human instinct to rationalize unthinkable horrors. But it is a real and harmful thing.

" 

&gt;First of all, sexual assault is punished severely.  

That's only once the rapist is convinced with any doubt.  How we handle accusations, charge crimes, and conduct trials is evidence there is a widespread rape culture. 

Women who report rape may not be believed.

Those that go to a hospital to get rape evidence collected may be liable for part of the bill.

Prosecuters are very reluctant to pursue a trial if the only proof the woman has is her word. 

If it makes it to trial, her entire private life is on trial.   Her job, the kind of friends she associates with,  sexual history in detail, any drug use ever,  any alcohol use,  and her behavior.   If she wore the wrong clothes, went out too late at night,  or visited the wrong club the jury is made to believe she was ""asking for it"".    What other violent crime can you think of where the private details of the VICTIM are put on trial?  And where the victim may be blamed for the assault for just walking down the wrong street or choosing the wrong skirt to wear.

&gt;Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized?

Do you ever hear the victim of a pickpocket being told ""you were asking for it""?   

Sex *can be consentual*.  Having a stranger remove your wallet is never consentual.    Rape culture is when outsiders see a rape victim and automatically think she was consenting.  She is guilty until proven innocent

Add to this the mindset some have that men's sexual feelings are women's responsibility.   It's the woman's fault if she causes men lustful thoughts. If you look to conservative religious groups,  you'll see that women are taught it's immoral to dress provocatively.   It's the *woman's fault* if the man does anything inappropriate. 

&gt;Of course, rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However, where's the line between helpful advice and ""rape culture?"". I think that some feminists confuse these two, placing both of them in the realm of ""rape culture"". 

The very nature of the helpful advice  is the problem.   It's the acceptance that it's OK for a man to dress any style,  walk home alone, go to a club, or leave with someone.  But when a woman does it, she's ""asking for it"" wearing that mini skirt and walking alone after dark.    We talk about equality for the sexes but how is it equal when men have more freedom?  And women are raised to hide indoors, only go out in large groups,and cover up.    Until you hear that message every time you go out,  you're not in a position to judge those raised to feel so vulnerable and at fault..

"The [CDC report on IPV and SV](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) uses a definition of rape that excludes male rape victims, instead classifying it as ""other sexual assault - forced to penetrate."" 

It was only 2 years ago that [the FBI changed its definition of rape to include men](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-01-06/fbi-rape-definition-adds-men/52398350/1), so until very recently the existence of male rape victims hasn't been acknowledged (and the FBI definition still doesn't account for men raped by women).

And while in the past couple years there has begun to be some acknowledgement of male rape victims, the general attitude is to belittle them, accuse them of being homosexual or say that it's any man's dream.

So in regards to what feminists talk about, you're right, it doesn't exist. But something pretty damn close to what feminists talk about exists - rape culture for men."	cl7htf5	t3_2j196u	anonlymouse	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not.

When it comes to rape in prison, people say they deserve it (like that is part of the their punishment for whatever they did to get themselves in jail), and whenever a story comes out about female on male statutory rape, all you see are stories about how lucky the kid is, and even when the women is being portrayed negatively, the word rape is usually conspicuously absent.	cl7ihis	t1_cl7hyci	Coldbeam	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

I've never understood this. To paint any rape in a positive light seems cruel. As a man, I can't even fathom the trauma of rape, but I can imagine it is a psychological shitstorm.

"&gt;people say they deserve it 

People are not one entity with one shared viewpoint. Some people say they deserve it, but I don't think stating that ""people"" say this or that is true. Prison rape is a problem. People who deny this or laugh about it are perpetuating rape culture. 

About the female-on-male statutory rape-- I see this a lot too. It's definitely an issue. It's a part of rape culture. 

I do not see why men experiencing rape culture must automatically = women not experiencing rape culture. Men having their own unique set of gender issues involving rape does not mean that women do not also have their own unique set of gender issues involving rape. I said somewhere else that rape culture refers to a culture in which rape is denied as being an issue while actually being an issue, is excused, even subtly, or is outright laughed at. I can say these things about both male and female rape."	cl7kppi	t1_cl7ihis	1au	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt;I've noticed that some crazy feminists belittle male rape victims, but so do many men

Which is pretty much everyone, and is what makes the idea of 'rape culture' actually fit.

To the extent that they're willing to acknowledge male rape victims exist. Usually that's in the form of men can be raped by other men, but the notion that women can rape men is outright rejected.

"http://now.org/blog/how-feminism-and-now-have-helped-men/

&gt;Feminists fought to change the federal definition of rape to include male victims, they fought for the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, 

&gt;In 1994, NOW was a leader in the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Though the law includes women in its title, **VAWA protects male victims of domestic violence**.

Which is actually pretty funny that MRAs are [against VAWA](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-governance-feminism/vawa-and-the-war-on-men/) while barely understanding [what it actually does](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/FAQ_VAWA%20and%20Gender.pdf)

So you included feminists in the people hat outright reject male rape

Honestly, I've never seen anything other than support for male rape awareness from feminists.  So no, ""some feminists"" are not ""finally acknowledging it,"" a vast majority of feminists have been acknowledging it.  I've pretty much never seem any well-recieved feminists ignore male rape.

"&gt;Which is pretty much everyone, and is what makes the idea of 'rape culture' actually fit.

I don't think crazy feminists + some men = pretty much everyone. 

&gt;To the extent that they're willing to acknowledge male rape victims exist. Usually that's in the form of men can be raped by other men, but the notion that women can rape men is outright rejected.

I said, ""In my experience, for the most part, most people (including feminists) that care about rape care about male rape victims."" Your reply confuses me. If the people I speak of care about male rape victims, they're both acknowledging it happens (which is where you say the extent of it ends) *and* caring about it -- as is implied by being people that *care about male rape victims*. If by your reply you actually just mean, ""No, in my experience, people don't care about male rape victims, because in actuality few people do more than acknowledge it, and the idea that women can rape men is rejected by most,"" then just say that! Because you basically are saying, ""yes, but only to the extent that *insert doing things that imply they don't actually even care*."" In which case we simply disagree on that point or have had different experiences. 

&gt;Anywhere it comes up. If there's a news article reporting on it, you'll see a lot of cruel comments. Now you can say not to read comments, but that isn't really the point.

I see a lot of cruel comments on articles about female rape victims as well. To be honest, I often see the most cruel replies regarding male rape victims coming from males or misandrist females. The other day I got into a facebook argument with a guy who posted an article about a 16yo student having sex with two of his female teachers. He captioned it with ""this guy has got game!"" and proceeded to argue that the boy knew what was happening and that it was explicitly different than a girl having sex with two older men. Most of the people chiming in and arguing my point were female. We could argue back and forth about our own anecdotal evidence, but it honestly doesn't matter. I know that many people don't take male rape seriously. But I also know that many don't take female rape seriously either.

&gt;So in regards to what feminists talk about, you're right, it doesn't exist. But something pretty damn close to what feminists talk about exists - rape culture for men.

... I don't understand why male rape victims having their own unique set of gender issues involving rape has to explicitly cancel out female issues of rape. Rape culture does exist, and it exists for both genders in different ways. Overall, rape culture refers to a culture in which rape is either denied as a problem while being a large problem, is excused, even subtly so, or is outright laughed at. I could say all of these things both about female rape and male rape.

For the record, I think the older definition of rape was disgusting and I'm glad it's becoming more gender inclusive so that people can legally seek justice.

The CDC (still) and FBI (until 2012 absolutely, and still in some cases) not recognising female on male rape is indicative of the sentiments of the general population.

&gt;.. I don't understand why male rape victims having their own unique set of gender issues involving rape has to explicitly cancel out female issues of rape

If a woman accuses a man of rape, he is presumed guilty in the press, his picture and name will be published for everyone to see, he has a good chance of losing his job, and if he's acquited it will be presented as a miscarriage of justice. That shows how seriously the general public takes male on female rape, and disproves the notion that rape culture exists for women.

"&gt;The CDC (still) and FBI (until 2012 absolutely, and still in some cases) not recognising female on male rape is indicative of the sentiments of the general population.

I'm not up to date on the definitions, but I think that's vile. Regardless, I don't think that represents most peoples' definition of rape. 

&gt;I know people who care about it too, in fact I'm one of them (otherwise I wouldn't have brought this up), but that doesn't mean they/we aren't in the minority.

You might be right, or wrong. I don't know. Most people I know agree with my stance, but then again, I'm at a university on the west coast in a super liberal area. Although I have found most people I've interacted with on Reddit also hold my stance. Same with Facebook and Tumblr. 

&gt;If a woman accuses a man of rape, he is presumed guilty in the press, his picture and name will be published for everyone to see, he has a good chance of losing his job, and if he's acquited it will be presented as a miscarriage of justice. That shows how seriously the general public takes male on female rape, and disproves the notion that rape culture exists for women.

Or it could totally destroy the woman's life. There are countless stories about women turned away from the police or mistreated or blamed or shamed-- just as males victims often are. The media often distorts shit for the general public, and the general public feeds off of it. Maybe if I'd gone to a reporter his life would actually be ruined-- and I've said in other places on this thread that I completely agree that reports of male rape victims are often phrased in a way that makes it seem less serious.

OP argues that it's not as significant as feminists claim, and you say that your point proves that rape culture doesn't exist for women. Like I said, I don't understand why male rape victims having their own unique set of gender issues involving rape has to explicitly cancel out female issues of rape. Just because in some cases women might have an easier time exposing the male for what he is doesn't mean in many other cases women are subjected to awful things perpetuated by rape culture-- blaming, isolation, harassment, etc. Both genders experience rape culture.

I think I might be coming at this differently than the OP intended, though-- I don't argue that rape culture is a gender-specific issue. I think rape as a whole affects males and females and we really need to work on how we attack it as a society.

It's not cancelling out female issues of rape. It's just that rape culture, as feminists describe it, doesn't exist for women, but does exist for men. So OP is half right and half wrong.

"I think it does exist for women as feminists describe it. They're often just focusing on the female side of it because they're usually female, and it comes off as seeming like they think it doesn't apply to men. Females can definitely experience much of what male rape victims experience (the being unable to report it, feeling ashamed, being made fun of, being isolated). The most notable difference (imo) is that males get more of the ""wow you were getting lucky"" whereas women get the ""you were asking for it"" ...which in a sense, is pretty similar. They're both insinuating the victim is at some sort of fault. 

I will agree that it's easier to ruin a male's life by accusing him of rape, though. But it would be wrong to ignore the fact that many females' lives can be ruined because they made a true rape accusation.

"Like I said, rape culture effects females and males differently. I'm totally agreeing with you on that.

&gt;How many women have been expelled from college based on a rape accusation? How many women have been attacked by vigilantes based on a rape accusation? There's a very clear difference between how society reacts to female rape victims and male rape victims. Society takes rape of women seriously enough that women can use false accusations to their advantage. Society is so dismissive of male rape victims that there's no point in men making a false accusation. 

How many women have been ostracized for reporting rape? How many women have been asked what they were wearing, what they were doing, how many women have had people tell them they were asking for it? How many women have been accused of making false accusations simply because they made *an* accusation? I know a few women who were raped that were laughed at by police and not taken seriously. I've seen friends (male and female) ostracized and isolated for coming out about their rape. 

&gt;Being able to use an accusation like that indicates the exact opposite of rape culture.

Being scared to report a rape for any reason is heartbreaking and indicates rape culture.

Male rape is not taken as seriously as it should be. Males experience rape culture. 

Women do as well. Women are victim blamed and laughed at and ignored just as men are. Women have been socialized to fear rape, and to think about it, on average, much more than the average male, so it makes sense that it is more common for a woman to report her rape and try to seek justice. We end up seeing this, and some people get the idea that it's somehow easy for a woman to report a rape, and that seeking justice will be a cakewalk.

You can google any number of keywords and read anecdotal evidence, personal essays, article, etc. 

Or the media reaction the Steubenville rape case. Or the woman working in a prison who was raped by an inmate, and the prison actually suggested it was her fault for not locking the door. Or my own personal anecdote, how I was treated after I told a few people that I'd been raped. People didn't believe me, some even went far enough to stalk me online and send me horrible messages about how I was making shit up for attention... keeping in mind that many of the people I told, I didn't even use the guy's name, because I didn't want to be sued and I had no evidence (as often happens with intimate partner rape). 

I get how people could be annoyed that women talk about rape culture when men are also experiencing it. But we aren't trying to monopolize the term. At the end of the day, on an individual level, when someone, male or female, is raped, the shit they are going to have to deal with is usually and mostly despicable. That is rape culture.

"&gt;It was only 2 years ago that the FBI changed its definition of rape to include men, so until very recently the existence of male rape victims hasn't been acknowledged (and the FBI definition still doesn't account for men raped by women).  

That was thanks to feminists, actually.  

&gt;&gt;Carol Tracy, executive director of the Women's Law Project, and 90 other organizations that support victims of sexual abuse have been pushing for such a change for more than a decade, saying that the public has long been ""misled"" about the prevalence of rape.  

http://www.womenslawproject.org/NewPages/wlpAbout_Us.html  

&gt;&gt;The Women's Law Project joined the fight for women's rights in 1974, founded by a group of feminist attorneys devoted to equality and justice. Emboldened by the resurgent feminist movement of the 1970s, we soon won national recognition for our trailblazing Equal Rights Amendment Project, combining extensive litigation under state ERAs with public education.

"The feminists were only campaigning for an expanded definition, of rape of women, which due to both men and women having anuses incidentally included men. It's only MRAs that have pushed for clarification and expansion of the definition to include envelopment. Feminists are happy to pat themselves on the back about that side effect, but haven't done anything to get it improved.

not quite 99%, but it's better than before. i agree that feminism has clearly (thanks to Mary Koss) tried to exclude male victims, and that it's absurd that feminists try to take credit for the change. i'm just pointing out the facts of that one change.	cl8nljh	t1_cl8lnpz	sarkcarter	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Rape Culture:

1.  People legitimately do not know what consent means.  I have friends who dated people that think being in a relationship means they're entitled to sex.  I was raped by a guy who didn't realize that the fact that I was on sleeping pills and said no 20 times meant that he could not have sex with me when I (nearly passed out from the sleeping pill that he knew i'd taken) eventually said yes.  We do not teach people how to have positive healthy relationships or what consent should look like.  

2. In fact we encourage them to have unhealthy relationships.  How many rom-coms follow the trope of ""chasing"" the girl who doesn't appear to be interested.  Following, continually asking, and coercing someone to have sex with you/be in a relationship is romanticized in media.

3.  Authority figures do not take charges of sexual assault seriously.  Anecdote: One of my friends was anally raped, and the police told her the prosecutor would not take her case because she had consensual sex with him previously.  Police frequently do not believe the victims, parents are ashamed and cover it up, schools want to avoid the publicity. 

4.  There are harsh punishments for rape, it's true.  Except when there are not: 
http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/steubenville-rapist-released-after-10-months-while-activist-who-exposed-him-faces
Or the judge who gave a light sentence to a teacher who raped a 14 year old because she ""looked older than her chronological age""
Or the fact that 97% of rapists will not be punished https://rainn.org/news-room/97-of-every-100-rapists-receive-no-punishment

5.  That people think being harassed, sexually assaulted, or even raped can be a compliment or a good thing.  This applies especially to overweight women and men who are raped by women.  

6.  That people feel entitled to other people's bodies.  Women are told to just ignore cat calling, yet they have been killed for ignoring or rejecting advances:
http://blackmillennials.com/2014/10/08/when-catcalling-kills-you/comment-page-1/
http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/21/when-street-harassment-is-more-deadly-than-catcalls/
Yet people tell me it's a compliment to be catcalled.  


7.  That people continue to make rape jokes when the evidence shows that it helps rapists to justify their belief that everyone would rape if they got the chance

"You stated that ""sexual assault is punished severely.""  Sadly, this is not the case.  According to a NY Times government survey, nearly 1 in 5 women have been raped, and 1 in every 33 men have been raped.  This number doesn't even cover other forms of sexual assault.  Moreover, according to the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Abuse Network, 60% of sexual assaults are not reported to the police, and 97% of rapists never spend a day in jail. 

I can also provide personal experience that speaks to this.  I personally was raped by a family member at a young age.  I was too afraid to speak out because I was afraid this family member would hurt me (worse) if I told.  I have another friend who was raped and was brave enough to go to the police.  Her rapist was not convicted in court because my friend did not outright express the words ""stop.""  Despite the fact that she tried to get away, tried too push him off, and cried during all of the intercourse, he was not convicted solely because she did not use exact verbal objection.

Rape culture is a very serious thing.  I understand what you are saying about advice--giving advice about how to better protect yourself is not harmful.  What is harmful is a society that pushes blame onto victims for a crime committed against them.  Rape victims are told that they did not make their objection clear enough, that they were inviting sex via certain behavior (being flirtatious, wearing certain clothing, etc.) despite their clear objections.  Justice has been breached on so many occasions because rape victims' point of view has been ignored and excuses have been made to protect rapists.  In many cases, rape victims are too scared to even report the crime because they are afraid either someone will get hurt (themself/loved ones) or they are afraid of public shaming.  Rape is an extremely traumatic experience.  Testifying about it in court forces the victim to relieve that experience over and over again in public.  Additionally, in many cases rapists are not convicted, and so the rape victim was forced to relieve their nightmare repeatedly and publicly only to receive zero resolution.  This results in shame, more guilt, and--of course--more trauma.

I have to go to work now but I hope this helps explain how serious Rape Culture is.  If I have time later I will find some example court cases to illustrate some of my points.

"Except we see this kind of thing very prominently with rape. We don't blame other victims of violent crimes like murder for their own death in the same way we do rape victims.  

And comparing those other crimes to rape is faulty. You can leave your belongings behind when you go someplace. A woman can't leave her vagina at home.  

Telling an individual woman not to go someplace might seem sensible, but when you start telling all women to avoid someplace you start having problems. That's not how society should deal with its problems.

"We do too blame the victims of violent crimes. I had some friends get mugged walking through a bad neighborhood. When they told people about it, everyone's response was immediately, ""Why were you walking through there in the first place? That was stupid."" 

There are threats out there that we have to protect ourselves from. I, a man, regularly carry a concealed weapon (legally) because I don't want to be defenseless if I or someone I care about is threatened. Do I expect it to happen? No, but I'm ready for it.

We can't just ""teach men not to rape"" and absolve women of all personal responsibility. You alone are responsible for your own personal safety and relying on others is naive and ignorant. The vast majority of men are not rapists. Rapists are a tiny group of psychopaths that no amount of social education will stop. We might as well not have soldiers in Afghanistan take measures to protect themselves. We should just teach Muslims not to blow up Americans.

"""Rapists are a tiny group of psychopaths that no amount of social education will stop""

I do not agree with that statement, not statistically or as an opinion. It is simply incorrect. 

Most 'rape' or sexual assault is committed by a sexual partner of the female, someone they have already had consensual sex with in the past,  but in that case they ignored a no, and/or did something specific that wasn't agreed to, etc. 

Date rape or acquaintance rape is much more common than rape by a stranger. (Grabbed in a dark alley, or hiding in the back seat.) 

As the definition of consent has evolved and become a societal discussion, there is less rape. Sexual assault is less common in modern societies than ever before in history. Education works.  

Less than 40 years ago it was legal to rape your wife.  Now it's not. A politician from Iowa was recently caught raping his wife in a nursing home. She is unable to give consent due to being unconscious. He was warned multiple times by staff to stop doing it before they finally called the cops. He didn't 'understand' it was a crime - after all, that's his wife and she gave consent for LIFE the day they married.

"&gt; Most 'rape' or sexual assault is committed by a sexual partner of the female, someone they have already had consensual sex with in the past, but in that case they ignored a no, and/or did something specific that wasn't agreed to, etc.

I was under the impression that the majority of rapes (at least in America) occurred between males in jail.

Still, these kinds of statistics will always be flawed because the biases of those collecting them and those using them will always be too great. Trying to find impartial statistics on a self reported and stigmatised phenomena like rape would be next to impossible at the best of times.

I'm always reminded about domestic violence statistics - so frequently they are defined as being unable to include any pairing other than an abusive male committing abuse against a female that they are (IMO) totally useless. 

Without firm unbiased stats, many of the statements and conclusions from those statements ITT are worse than speculation because they are presented as facts, when they are nothing of the sort.

&gt; Date rape or acquaintance rape is much more common than rape by a stranger.

All forms of crime are more commonly perpetrated within a social grouping. There's nothing unique about rape in that.

&gt; As the definition of consent has evolved and become a societal discussion, there is less rape. Sexual assault is less common in modern societies than ever before in history. Education works.

I don't know if that is entirely true or not. I don't ever want to speak ill of education, but all forms of crime are dropping across the board - not just the ones that it is assumed can be reduced via education.

I suspect that there is some other influencing factor at play here that is contributing or driving this effect. As to what that might be, I'm not really sure.

&gt; A politician from Iowa was recently caught raping his wife in a nursing home.

I'd rather that we not use ethical outliers like politicians as examples of typical behaviour. Most politicians would rape their own kids on live TV if it guaranteed their next election.

&gt; In addition, serial rapists are definitely mentally ill, but are not psychopaths.

This is another one of these we don't have the stats situations.

True psychopaths are frequently rapey, and sociopaths can be rapey for similar reasons, but are more frequently manipulative rather than coercive. It is worth mentioning that diagnosable sociopathic tendencies occur in approximately 10% of the population, and that sub-clinical presentations occur at higher rates than that. Then there are the people that are just bad - they have all the brain hardware required for ethical conduct, but either didn't receive the nurture to go with the nature, or simply chose not to act ethically.

The above (and the fact that I have a mental illness) is why I object to the labelling of all rapists as mentally ill. If the law decides that you have agency (and the law typically does for 'paths provided they aren't batshit nuts, and frequently even then) then you aren't doing it because you're ill or without choice, you're doing it of your own volition."	cl7j3jg	t1_cl7fpgh	cfuse	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

&gt;We can't just ""teach men not to rape"" and absolve women of all personal responsibility. You alone are responsible for your own personal safety and relying on others is naive and ignorant. The vast majority of men are not rapists. Rapists are a tiny group of psychopaths that no amount of social education will stop.   

And that's where you're wrong. The vast majority of rapists are not psychopaths waiting to ambush you in the middle of the street. They are people you know, people who have flawed understanding of what consent means.  

Hell, you are proof of that flawed understanding. You just said that rapists are all violent psychopaths. There are many many people who still think as you do. That rapists are scary people and couldn't possibly be like one of us. But they are, and they exist because they don't take consent seriously.

"You didn't read past page 2 of that report.

Go a little deeper and you [see other things:](https://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf)

&gt; RAINN recommends a three-tiered approach when it comes to preventing sexual violence on college campuses. A prevention campaign should include the following elements:  
1. Bystander intervention education: empowering community members to act in response to acts of sexual violence.  
2. Risk-reduction messaging: empowering members of the community to take steps to increase their personal safety.  
3. General education to promote understanding of the law, particularly as it relates to the ability to consent.  

-
&gt; Rape is all too often a crime without consequences. In America, out of every 100 rapes, only 40 are reported to police, and only three rapists will ever spend a day behind bars. On college campuses, the situation is even worse: according to the Justice Department, one in every five women will be sexually assaulted while in college, yet just 12% report the assault to law enforcement.  
This disturbingly low reporting rate amounts to a massive missed opportunity in the fight against campus sexual assault. When these crimes aren’t reported, not only do victims often fail to receive the vitally important services and supports they need (as they are more likely to suffer a host of long - term health effects), but serial criminals are left unpunished and free to strike again. And the message this sends to the broader community and future offenders? You can rape with impunity; that’s just what happens in college.  

-
&gt; We urge the federal government to explore ways to ensure that college and universities treat allegations of sexual assault as they would murder and other violent felonies. The fact that the criminal justice process is difficult and imperfect, while true, is not sufficient justification for bypassing it in favor of an internal system that will never be up to the challenge.         

The point of the RAINN report was to encourage the federal government to strengthen laws and punishments around rape (including punishing colleges and universities for not taking it seriously), increasing the amount of awareness toward what constitutes consent (especially in a legal way, where state laws are different), creating ways for sexual assault victims to come forward more easily, and having things like forensic exams (such as rape kits) readily available. All of these are *great* things to push for and it's obvious they are working with all of the best intentions for the safety of women on campuses.  

The ""rape culture"" bit of the report was *not* the conclusion of it. That author simply disagreed on how to tackle the problem, but they agreed that rape is still a *huge* issue."	cl7g93l	t1_cl7fxo3	IAmAN00bie	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"yes, they acknowledge that rape is a problem that has solutions, but that doesn't mean there is rape culture. they don't blame culture at all. it's the same with other crimes, you can address ways to reduce them without blaming society as a whole.

they actually bluntly state that ""Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.""

or how about the quote ""By the time they reach college, most students have been exposed to 18 years of prevention messages, in one form or another.

"&gt; The vast majority of rapists are not psychopaths waiting to ambush you in the middle of the street. 

Nobody in this thread said ""waiting to ambush you in the middle of the street"".

In fact, I've never heard anybody claiming that the typical rape was the perpetrator ambushing the victim in the middle of the street. It seems that this is a strawman put forward by those who claim that ""rape culture"" exists.

&gt; They are people you know, people who have flawed understanding of what consent means. 

[Research suggests otherwise](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/). The vast majority of rapes are committed by a minority of men who what they are doing and also admit committing other kinds of violent offences.

"&gt;Change the culture. To rape again and again, these men need silence. They need to know that the right combination of factors — alcohol and sex shame, mostly — will keep their victims quiet. Otherwise, they would be identified earlier and have a harder time finding victims. The women in your life need to be able to talk frankly about sexual assault. They need to be able to tell you, and they need to know that they can tell you, and not be stonewalled, denied, blamed or judged.

&gt;However, researchers say that acquaintance rapists generally share common characteristics: the ability to enjoy sex even with someone who is intoxicated, crying, pleading, resisting, vomiting and/or unconscious, and an exaggerated sense of entitlement and lack of guilt, remorse, empathy and compassion for others

I have an incredibly hard time believing that the majority of rape is just misinformed men making bad decisions. Some rape? Absolutely. But most of it? That's just silly. Just because most rape is committed by somebody the victim knows, doesn't mean that those rapists aren't still psychopaths looking for a moment to strike. In fact, psychopaths and sociopaths are usually very good at manipulating other people.	cl7fr4z	t1_cl7fa3c	Kairah	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I also disagree with you, and I think this survey says a lot about the nature of the [misinformed men](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/).  Men reject the label of rapist, but they freely admit to having sex without consent.  The misinformation is not a lack of understanding that 'rape is bad.' These men do not understand that having sex without consent makes them a rapist.  Which is a bit astonishing. 

Some notes re: the study: 

**1882 college students, ranging in age from 18 to 71 with a median age of 26.5 

**120 men, 6% of respondents, admitted to having sex without consent. The article subsequently refers to these men as rapists, a definition I agree with.

**Of all 120 admitted rapists, only about 30% reported using force or threats, while the remainder raped intoxicated victims.

**Of the 120 rapists in the sample, 44 reported only one assault. The remaining 76 were repeat offenders. These 76 men, 63% of the rapists, committed 439 rapes or attempted rapes, an average of 5.8 each (median of 3, so there were some super-repeat offenders in this group). Just 4% of the men surveyed committed over 400 attempted or completed rapes.

I also agree with the writer's conclusion as to how we can break the culture surrounding this issue - men have a large role to play: 
""Choose not to be part of a rape-supportive environment. Rape jokes are not jokes. Woman-hating jokes are not jokes. These guys are telling you what they think. When you laugh along to get their approval, you give them yours. You tell them that the social license to operate is in force; that you’ll go along with the pact to turn your eyes away from the evidence; to make excuses for them; to assume it’s a mistake, of the first time, or a confusing situation. You’re telling them that they’re at low risk.""  "	cl7hq0x	t1_cl7fr4z	Bethamphetamine	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I chose my wording poorly because I didn't mean to imply that literally every rapist was a psychopath, but that I absolutely don't believe that the majority of rapists committed rape simply because they ""didn't understand consent"" or similar nonsense. Indeed, they almost seem like excuses that somebody would come up with to defend their unethical actions as justifiable. It's fluff. It's similar to the argument that if shoplifters understood how their actions end up hurting almost exclusively low-level employees that they would stop shoplifting. They'd just find another way to justify their actions because they're criminals."	cl7y4fl	t1_cl7hgjg	Kairah	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Someone posted a reply here that really drives my point home, but they deleted it. I'm going to post it anyway because I already had the reponse typed up by the time it was gone:

---

&gt; &gt;But on top of that, most advice to avoid rape is just terrible.

&gt; Not really, saying ""if you have to walk home late, go together with someone or go through places where there are a lot of people"" is not terrible, it helps women know how to avoid rapists as much as possible. It helps people rather than hurts them

---

That is, in fact, an example of terrible advice. It makes women feel less safe and doesn't actually give them any more safety. I consider telling people they should live in a constant state of fear a form of harm. It causes anxiety and stress, and those have real, physical effects. Telling a woman that just drives home that they are powerless and weak and always vulnerable. 

The vast majority of rapes happen between friends or acquaintances. Some guy grabbing a woman in a dark alleyway and raping her is just not a thing that happens with any frequency. If you want to give women tips on how to not be raped, teach them how to spot creepy behavior of the people they know, and how to get out of situations with friends where they don't feel safe. Teach them it's okay to tell someone they're making her uncomfortable and that she would like to leave."	cl7fm9r	t1_cl7f0q3	Amablue	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

I think your last point is basically the only piece of advice I would feel comfortable saying women should by and large should be taught. Because most men don't consider what they have done as being rape, if women assert themselves they may actually be able to bring what is happening into the consciousness of their friend/acquaintance before it goes too far. This doesn't teach women that the world is unsafe for them but that, like anyone else, if they are uncomfortable they have the right to speak up for themselves and let others know they feel that way.	cl7iosp	t1_cl7fm9r	kim-possible	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

So you admit that it's detrimental but your response is 'meh, that's life'? This is why we need movements that help change cultures. You know what would help crime in those areas go down? More stable socioeconomic situations, increased access to education and opportunities, increased services etc. Telling certain populations not to go to those areas because 'all them dangerous poor people will mug you' is not helping to move society in a better direction. Much in the same way that giving men the tools to know when they do not have consent helps move society in a better direction while telling women how to avoid being victims does not. The current situation doesn't have to be the future, but it will if we focus on victim blaming and this is what rape culture is all about: blaming the victim so that society doesn't have to cope with changing.	cl7ivkk	t1_cl7fm7k	kim-possible	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I'm going to copypasta /u/i_lack_imagination from elsewhere in this thread, because I think the response nails it:

&gt;I think I see this with other crimes as well. In general, it seems to me its the way people/society deals with things they wish didn't happen but feel they have no power to stop. People like to believe that these bad things can be prevented, they want to believe it won't happen to them.
So when these things do happen, whether it be a mugging or burglary or rape etc., it's challenging that inner mindset that they have control. If they can not walk in a bad neighborhood and avoid being mugged, then they have control. If they can lock the doors on their house and not get burglarized, they have control. If these things don't stop them from being victimized, what will? It's hard for them to accept that they are at the mercy of pure chance, at any time anything bad could happen to them and there's nothing they can do about it.
To further the point that this isn't about rape but all crime, look at how well the 2nd amendment is propped up for self defense reasons. It's consistently the #1 reason people use to defend the 2nd amendment. It's about power and control and the idea that people can prevent themselves from being victimized. It's of course a flawed idea, but I don't think its right to single out the rape situation as though it doesn't happen elsewhere. It's a victim blaming culture because people don't want to believe they could be a victim.

Victim blaming isn't a rape culture problem, its an American culture problem."	cl7j2v9	t1_cl7ivkk	down42roads	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Victim blaming as part of rape culture. Victim blaming is also part of other problems in American culture. The presence of one in no way excludes the presence of the other. 

Rape culture is also about more than just victim blaming. 

Ending rape culture is a movement which focuses on ending sexualized violence against women by changing the way our culture views rape and consent. How we look at and lower risk of other types of crimes are not going to require the same focus. It is about people vs cultural beliefs which excuse rape. It is about educating both men and women as to what constitutes consent. "	cl7kg3q	t1_cl7j2v9	kim-possible	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

If your argument is that women are already doing enough to prevent rape, and that doing anything else is putting too much of a burden on the woman, that sounds like a very flawed understanding of how the world works. Good people are always at risk of bad things happening to them, and the pressure to stop these bad things doesn't deserve to be placed on the victims, but it does.

"When?

And certainly nowhere near on the scale that it happens to women who get raped. Despite ZERO evidence that a woman's clothing has any bearing on her likelihood to get raped, it is still brought up in a majority of court cases. That is rape culture. It would be like asking men who were assaulted if they had a mustache at the time -- even though of course, mustaches have nothing to do with why you were assaulted and are in no way correlated with being mugged -- but when you're sitting in that court room and facing down that defense attorney, you can be damned sure he's going to ask you about your facial hair.

I may still have lecture notes or a textbook kicking around which I can look for in terms of more specific sources. I will say a few things up front though:

1) The problem was a big enough deal that Florida had to make a law forbidding it after someone was acquitted because of his victim's dress.

2) My use of the word majority may have been incorrect as it has been a few years since taking those courses. I apologize if that is the case. It was a significant issue.

3) I didn't say it was used to excuse the rape. It's usually used as part of a package which intends to portray the victim as promiscuous and probably asking for it.

"&gt; Telling an individual woman not to go someplace might seem sensible, but when you start telling all women to avoid someplace you start having problems. That's not how society should deal with its problems.

Women are free to go wherever they wish, they just aren't free of the consequences of those choices. If they choose to get blind drunk in the middle of an equally blind drunk group of men (some of which are guaranteed to be predatory) then who's going to be shocked when things turn out badly? Nobody deserves to be a victim of crime, but voluntarily placing yourself at high risk is both an act of personal responsibility and incredibly stupid - and we should be able to criticise people for that.

I am a gay man, and like every gay man I can tell you places I won't go, and places I will go to great pains to appear straight in - exactly because I don't want to risk being abused, assaulted, raped, or murdered. I don't say that I should be safe to go anywhere (because it's never going to be safe to go everywhere in the world being gay) I assess the risk and if it's too high I GTFO. That won't put my risk of being a victim of crime (including rape) at zero, but it will reduce it - and that's all that I can reasonably be expected to do to ensure my own safety.

Pragmatism beats naive ideology any day of the week. Sure, work towards making the world a better place, but don't delude yourself that voluntarily walking into danger with blinkers on is either safe or an act that will contribute to the future safety of others. We badly need to move society in the direction of encouraging personal responsibility - we should stop telling people that it is never their fault and start telling them that making good choices beats getting raped because you were dumb."	cl7idfa	t1_cl7e7h4	cfuse	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; Telling an individual woman not to go someplace might seem sensible, but when you start telling all women to avoid someplace you start having problems. That's not how society should deal with its problems.

That's not how society should deal with its problems, but it is how society **DOES** deal with its problems. You really think that the only crime where any ""victim blaming"" occurs is rape? That's where you're totally 100% wrong. Do we not warn people to not walk around the ghetto at night? I guess we must be victim blaming them then! 

Life is full of potential problems that **EVERYONE** must be wary of, and you must act accordingly to prevent those problems. Just because someone tells you to take precautions does not mean they are saying that you are 100% responsible for what happened to you. Its just them being a damn realist and understanding that this world is not all flowers and rainbows and happiness. 

No offense, but if you're too caught up in thinking that the world is going to take its own precautions to protect you, then you're really setting yourself up for one bad thing after another to happen to you. Survival of the fittest is a real thing. Those who survive are the ones who can use their foresight to take precautions to prevent harm from coming their way.

A significant amount of this rape culture victim blaming thing is so damn perpetuated by feminists that its gotten ridiculous. **there is a difference between me telling you to not walk home from a bar alone and me telling you that you're at fault for being raped** .

"You're also basically enabling rape culture by limiting it to women.

You're right. Mugging victims aren't targeted for what's in their wallets either, because you don't know what's in there beforehand. People also can't legally leave their wallets at home most times as they need their licenses for driving. I'm not even sure that I disagree with your argument about the existence of rape culture, but you are literally do exactly the same thing to mugging victims. You're making it their fault by saying there is something they could do to avoid it just as others make it the victims fault by saying they could have avoided it. It makes no sense.

"This is silly for two reasons. 1) The first is gender neutral advice to everyone who wants safe belongings while the second is targeted only at women and limits only their behaviours.

It's offensive and limits only some of the population's ability to express themselves while cisgendered white males do not have to limit themselves in those same ways for the sake of ""safety"".

I also don't think people should leave their wallets at home. I think we should focus on making society safe so that people can carry whatever they want in whatever outfit they want.

What I am saying is that the logic behind the two statements is the same. Saying that telling women to avoid rapey situations is different from telling people to avoid muggings is just logically incorrect

People have the right to safely carry a wallet, and people have the right to safely go out in public dressed how they please. I'm saying that telling people to leave wallets, which most of the time they need, at home is just as dumb as telling people to avoid getting raped.

"I disagree with your last point because we cannot address all crime the same way. Ending rape culture is a movement which focuses on ending sexualized violence against women by changing the way our culture views rape and consent. How we look at and lower risk of other types of crimes are not going to require the same focus. 

The fact that young men are more likely to get involved with gang violence and is largely a 'men's issue' as a result of our culture requires a different approach and is another area where we tend to blame the victims of violence for getting involved in dangerous situation. The presence of this phenomenon of victim blaming does not remove, nor can it be lumped in with, the presence of rape culture. 

Different crimes perpetrated for different reasons cannot all be treated as one goal of 'people vs crime' because there is no one-size-fits-all solution. 

Finally, ending rape culture is not about women vs men at all. It is about people vs cultural beliefs which excuse rape. It is about educating both men and women as to what constitutes consent. Rape culture is also detrimental to men because it paints men as animals who can't help themselves or be helped so women had damned well better avoid them because they're all rapists as soon as the right opportunity comes along.

"Just because the solution isn't the same, and just because the crime can't be treated the same, does not mean it can't be people against crime. I didn't say they should be treated the same. Both are still crimes, and both should be fought.

I fail to see why, even given everything you said, the logic is any different. In both circumstances we should teach people not to commit crimes, not teach victims to avoid them. The details of how to do that vary, but the principle is the same.

I also disagree that culture excuses rape. I've never seen rapists regarded as anything other than hideous monsters, and victims regarded as victims.

So if the crime isn't the same, and how we address it isn't the same, why are you arguing against ending rape culture as a movement?

"&gt; But how is that significantly different for advising someone to change their practices after being mugged in a dark alley

Does this actually happen? 

Either way, it's just as dumb. Do you think someone who just suvived a potentially traumatic experience doesn't have the presence of mind to realize ""yeah, maybe that's a bad idea to do in the future"". It's really patronizing.

"I think I see this with other crimes as well. In general, it seems to me its the way people/society deals with things they wish didn't happen but feel they have no power to stop. People like to believe that these bad things can be prevented, they want to believe it won't happen to them. 

So when these things do happen, whether it be a mugging or burglary or rape etc., it's challenging that inner mindset that they have control. If they can not walk in a bad neighborhood and avoid being mugged, then they have control. If they can lock the doors on their house and not get burglarized, they have control. If these things don't stop them from being victimized, what will? It's hard for them to accept that they are at the mercy of pure chance, at any time anything bad could happen to them and there's nothing they can do about it.

To further the point that this isn't about rape but all crime, look at how well the 2nd amendment is propped up for self defense reasons. It's consistently the #1 reason people use to defend the 2nd amendment. It's about power and control and the idea that people can prevent themselves from being victimized. It's of course a flawed idea, but I don't think its right to single out the rape situation as though it doesn't happen elsewhere. It's a victim blaming culture because people don't want to believe they could be a victim."	cl7ipy2	t1_cl7emwy	i_lack_imagination	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

I agree that giving any sort of advice to a victim of a traumatic experience often times does nothing to help, and can actually exasperate the situation, but sometimes that's all you can do. My sister was attacked and had her head busted open, and my family and I didn't know what to do after that.  We started out just trying to comfort her by saying it will all be better, but that didn't seem to help. Eventually we were trying to say that it wouldn't happen again if where it happened was brighter, or if she had gone through earlier.  We hoped that something would make her feel better, but nothing did. When something like that happens to someone you love, you have to do something to try and make them feel better.  It's just human nature, and the goal is not to blame the victim, but to try and make sure they never get hurt that way again.	cl7ggbo	t1_cl7ea5v	Y2k20	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; This is a really paternalistic view to hold. I think you're being cynical rather than realistic here.

An average IQ is supposed to be 100. That doesn't mean that most people have an IQ of 100 - it's an average, not a median. This means two things to me: a hell of a lot of people are going to be on the ugly side of that bell curve, and an 100 of IQ is far from smart IMO.

We don't have any decent metrics for 'EQ' (terrible term) or cunning, but I'd argue that a huge portion of the population fail in those areas too.

Perhaps my experience isn't representative, but I can only go off of my experiences. I've found plenty (not all, and certainly not the majority) of people that needed someone else to do the bulk of their thinking for them. You call it paternalism, and I call it duty of care (when it's primarily for their benefit) or expedience (when it's primarily for mine) - if I want to achieve goals in cooperation with others and those others aren't capable of doing it under their own steam, then I don't have a problem 'giving them the answers' if I don't have the time to educate them (or they don't have the capacity to understand, or I'm simply not interested in educating them).

As with children: just because a person has agency doesn't necessarily mean they understand how to exercise it. People can easily do more than they already do, and people can do what they are directed to do, so it seems logical to me that another person can make use of their capacity to work by giving them directives (and hopefully those directives are a product of intelligence and wisdom).

If I can see that a person is about to fuck themselves over with their own actions, and I'm concerned that they are going to harm themselves, then don't I have a duty to warn them of that? If they've just fucked themselves over and don't understand why, and they're inviting my opinion, then shouldn't I give it to them? Shouldn't I engender trust in me and my advice in that person if that's going to ultimately benefit them? They still have agency, they can still ignore me if they choose, I don't have any magical powers of mind control - I'm helping them (if I'm acting ethically, which is most of the time).

As this applies to rape victims, it's of little use for the individual that has been raped. If that person did something that contributed to their predicament then it doesn't matter because the damage is done (and they are unlikely to benefit from any corrective measures. Quite possibly ever, depending on the level of trauma). However, depending on circumstance, their predicament can be used as an object lesson for others - as I said before, if I can see the capacity for harm then I have a duty of care to attempt to prevent that harm. 

I'm not about to say to a teenager ""You have the right to go anywhere, dress and act in any manner, and get as intoxicated as you like, and no sexual assault that happens to you is your responsibility or was contributed to by you in any way"", I'm going to say ""Nobody deserves to be raped, but there are ways that you can act that will put you at greater risk of sexual assault - so don't fucking act that way"". The cost of letting people misuse their agency is simply too high to sit back and hope they figure it out on their own before they get raped. Somebody else's dependents can get raped because they were imprudent, it won't be happening to mine if I can help it.

When I was in hospital, in a locked ward, two men came up to me with the intention of sexually assaulting me. I didn't sit there and say ""I've got a right to be here unmolested"". My rights were irrelevant at that point. I said ""I'm going to fucking kill you"" and I meant it - because the kind of people that are going to assault you aren't going to respect any amount of feminist theory of consent. They will respect the idea that you are going to smash their skull on concrete like it's a coconut you're trying to get open. They didn't leave me alone because they respected my rights or learned anything, they left me alone because they weren't prepared to pay the costs of assaulting me. My point in all of this is that I was in a dangerous situation through no fault of my own and I didn't naively fall back on some waffle about what I should be entitled to - I acted to mitigate the situation (and there's no guarantee that's always going to work, but I can guarantee that it's going to work better than expecting people that have already decided to reject part of the social contract to honour it). You are only going to be extended your rights by people that accept your right to them - and rapists aren't among their number. If the face of that you must defend your rights for yourself - and the best strategy for winning any fight is to avoid having it in the first place (which is why where you go, whether you look like an easy target, etc. are issues in rape (by the opportunistic anyway - a good chunk of rapists aren't strangers or casual acquaintances, so none of this advice really applies to that circumstance)).

Still, all of that is veering off course a bit (even if it is relevant to the main topic of the thread)."	cl84oip	t1_cl7rdx8	cfuse	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"&gt; An average IQ is supposed to be 100.

The average IQ is 100 by definition. If the population as a whole gets smarter or dumber for whatever reason, that changes what 100 means. 

&gt;  it's an average, not a median

A median is a kind of average. Furthermore, an IQ of 100 *is* the median. IQ is measured in terms of how many standard deviations you are from the median, which is converted to a points scale.

&gt; I've found plenty (not all, and certainly not the majority) of people that needed someone else to do the bulk of their thinking for them.

I'm calling BS here. Excluding children and the mentally ill and other obvious cases where people need caretakers, what normal adults need people do to the bulk of their thinking for them? This whole train of thought makes me think of [this](http://xkcd.com/610/). You can't see the thoughts other people have, you just see their actions, and conclude they didn't put thought into their actions. What things are you seeing people do that makes you think they're as mindless as you say they are?

&gt; and I call it duty of care

Unless you're caring for some sick family member or friend, why do you think you have this duty? Why do you think people would even want you to be exercising this perceived duty?

&gt; If I can see that a person is about to fuck themselves over with their own actions, and I'm concerned that they are going to harm themselves, then don't I have a duty to warn them of that?

Depends on the situation, and how equipped you are to dispense advice. If you're giving advice to women on how to not be raped, like most people you're probably actually giving them bad advice that does more harm than good. 

&gt; However, depending on circumstance, their predicament can be used as an object lesson for others - as I said before, if I can see the capacity for harm then I have a duty of care to attempt to prevent that harm.

If you want to prevent rape, the most effective action you can take is to teach people what rape is and not do it, not police the behavior of women. If there's anything that women need to know its that it's okay to leave a situation they are not comfortable in, and they need to be taught that they don't need to be pleasant and polite to others. What clothes they wear and what streets they walk down are far less important things to worry about. In fact, women wearing the stereotypically 'slutty' clothes are *less* likely to be raped. 

&gt;  I'm going to say ""Nobody deserves to be raped, but there are ways that you can act that will put you at greater risk of sexual assault - so don't fucking act that way""

So again, you're going to be giving bad advice. You're going to tell them how they should dress and where they should go, despite these not being correlated with an increase in rape.

"Up front: IQ isn't something I hold in a great esteem. I feel that using it for drawing conclusions about society is highly problematic. Statistics are horribly misunderstood (to the point that major statistical errors occur in *science journals* on a regular basis. Stats are hard maths that look deceptively simple).

In the context of our conversation bear in mind that my statements are opinions and anecdotes. I'm not a statistician, nor am I sitting here with references for my arguments (I'd like to think I'm not pulling it out of my ass, but that's not for me to decide).

&gt; The average IQ is 100 by definition. If the population as a whole gets smarter or dumber for whatever reason, that changes what 100 means.

Unless we are talking about historical comparisons (which I don't think we are), then barring unexpected distribution patterns^(1) it is reasonable to use 100 IQ points as a mid-point of average intelligence, and values higher as higher intelligence markers, and lower values lower.

The value of an IQ point is variable. You are correct that points can change value, as an obvious result of the change in the value of a single point the associated meaning of smart and dumb moves right along with it. If person A has an IQ of 120 and person B has an IQ of 80, then point values can change but the distance between A and B is always going to be in the same ratio regardless of the granularity of the measurement between them.

Basically, 100 means 100 because it is an average score - it doesn't change meaning if the ends of the scale move up or down. Distribution and statistical adjustments to the test itself are more relevant to whether a given value is smart or dumb (ignoring confounding factors like the Flynn effect).

&gt; A median is a kind of average. Furthermore, an IQ of 100 is the median. IQ is measured in terms of how many standard deviations you are from the median, which is converted to a points scale.

A median is *not* a kind of average (at least not in mathematical terms). 

An IQ of 100 is the median *and* the average as a function of the distribution and sample size (and even granularity of point value). They aren't the same by meaning, but they are the same by value.

I hate this kind of thing. These are the kind of subtle context and meaning issues that creep into discussions (along with terms like *average* meaning different things in normal use to their meaning in statistics).

Whether this boils down to splitting hairs or critical points of contention is what makes statistics so vexatious. It takes a great deal of skill and attention to know which is which in a given situation, and I admit that I do make mistakes in this area.

&gt;I'm calling BS here. Excluding children and the mentally ill and other obvious cases where people need caretakers, what normal adults need people do to the bulk of their thinking for them? 

Have a good look at MSM. Incredibly simple (and biased) narratives, prepackaged into digestible chunks. Nobody's being asked to think, or ask questions - they are being presented with a trough full of low grade informational glop, and the majority gobble it down like it's their last meal.

People don't require much in the way of intellect to exist (and thrive) in Western society. If you can clean, feed, and dress yourself, and make it to your register/cubical/worksite then you're achieving. By my standards we are asking for pretty much nothing from people in society (and my annoyance aside, society works just fine that way).

Go to a library, or a gallery, or a university and see how many people are there - and then go to a stadium on match day. Sports are dumb - sports require little intellect to play, and virtually no intellect to watch. Sports are incredibly popular, intellectually empty, and ultimately without meaning (that's not to say that there's no point to them, or that they shouldn't exist, merely that their popularity is an indicator that a huge segment of the population would rather spend their free time not thinking about anything more challenging than the odds of the Elks beating the Hawks).

&gt; This whole train of thought makes me think of this. 

The first step in raising oneself above exceptionalism is to understand that the likelihood of being exceptional is incredibly low. There are roughly 6.5 billion people on the planet - being in the top 5% in the world means you're in a group of 325 million others. That's roughly the population of America - that's a lot of people.

Even the fact that you are unique isn't the same as being of merit^(2). Snowflakes are unique, but they're only snowflakes.

Every time someone tells me I'm unique or special I cannot help but laugh. I am virtually identical to millions, similar to billions today, and similar to billions before me and hundreds of billions to follow me. I like myself, but I'm under no illusions as to my objective value.

&gt; You can't see the thoughts other people have, you just see their actions, and conclude they didn't put thought into their actions. What things are you seeing people do that makes you think they're as mindless as you say they are?

We're certainly making advances on the fNMRI front in regards to that, but there's plenty still to be done.

As to me being able to see the thoughts of others, I don't need to to be able to to make an assessment of their capabilities. It is only a person's actions that matter - who cares about a richness of thought that is never expressed? It might as well not exist.

Let's talk about *black box processing*: In black box processing you have a 'box' that performs some processing and you are unable to examine the contents of the box. However, you *can* examine the inputs to the box, and the outputs from the box. Human minds are black boxes, and they are subject to analysis as such. You look at the inputs, you look at the outputs, and you infer the processing that is occurring.

Several years ago I found that people were a bit of a mystery to me, and sometimes that resulted in poor outcomes for me. I decided to remedy that, and so I started experimenting on people to see how they worked. I would deliberately communicate with them in malformed ways to see what happened. I learned a surprising amount from that.

To refer back to uniqueness, people's thinking typically isn't. I know what most people are thinking in a given situation. Knowing their thoughts and disposition you have a very good chance of predicting behaviour. There's also the fact that the majority of people don't think at all - they are reactive, and simply do what they've always done or respond to how they feel, rather than critically examining a situation.

People are no more mindless than a diabetic is missing a pancreas - they have the organ, it just doesn't perform as well as that of others^(3).

&gt; Unless you're caring for some sick family member or friend, why do you think you have this duty? Why do you think people would even want you to be exercising this perceived duty?

If we are talking from an altruistic point of view: I've received a gift of both intelligence and divergent thinking. I believe I have an obligation in that to use those abilities for the betterment of all. If I can fix problems, then I should. If I can help people, then I should. My brain's abilities are almost entirely a product of biology, but my altruism is a core value that has been developed by environment more than being solely innate.

My wealth is my mind, and I'm willing to give it away charitably. I accept that people can refuse my help, I'm not going to force it onto them.

There's a less altruistic side too: I'm human, and I have flaws - I don't always act selflessly. My mind is as much a weapon as it is a tool. I can use my capabilities to get what I want, one way or another. When I'm like that, I will box people into a position where the only option they have is to comply. I'm less about the subtle politics of persuasion and more about being a human steamroller by nature, but I know how to modulate my behaviour for the sake of the outcome - because that's all that matters.

I've had some shitty experiences in my life (and plenty of them have been because of my altruism being exploited) and my tendency to act selflessly has been curtailed because of that. I don't give without making a risk assessment. I'm much more careful with my time and energy. I've also become a fan of revenge and negative consequences - if people cross me then I will make them wish they'd died.

1) [Apologies for the tiny picture.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/IQ_distribution.svg) This is what the distribution looks like.

2) Despite what our stupid culture inculcates at every turn. The cult of the individual has a lot to answer for.

3) There is a taboo in our society against claiming that some are smarter than others. If you are intelligent, or claim thus, you are seen as haughty. The only socially acceptable stances of an intelligent person are extreme humility or denial. Likewise, being less intelligent is considered a source of shame, and to be labelled unintelligent (even when true) is a slur. The only people it is acceptable for to express their true intellect is those in the middle of the herd (by my standards these people are dumb relative to myself).

The whole social stigma of intelligence is strange to me, and I don't really understand why it exists (if there is a purpose to it rather than just being luck of the draw). We accept the biological nature of beauty, athletic performance, various other physical, behavioural, and aptitudes, but intelligence is not accepted. If you're born with the capacity to be beautiful you aren't judged particularly harshly for that advantage (if at all), if you're born with a body that performs in a sport you'll be lauded for it, but if you are born with the capacity for intellect you are pilloried for it.

Everything depends on context, the individual makes their own assessment of that.

I have an opinion about what *people* should and shouldn't do as a matter of pragmatism to reduce their risk of sexual assault. My opinion is nothing more than an opinion, nor does it guarantee that sexual assault won't occur anyway (and it is impossible to quantify if *any* advice makes any difference at all). As I said, if I believe that people are acting in a manner that could endanger themselves then I generally wish to try to prevent that. Do I do that for every individual? No, I don't. Do I express that in forums like this as a broad principle? Sure, why not?

Every person has the right to do as they wish, they just have to accept the consequences of their actions. 

I believe in personal responsibility, and that is contrary to feminist dogma (which is where a lot of modern attitudes to issues of consent and sexual assault come from). Feminists believe that it is never the fault of the victim, and that any assertion in that direction is 'victim shaming'. I believe that the situation isn't black and white, and that people can influence what happens to them (to some degree). One stance tells people that they are free to do whatever they like and they'll never be responsible for anything that goes wrong, the other holds that people have an onus to ensure their own safety, and that part of that is the choice of modulating their behaviour^(1).

&gt; If you want to prevent rape, the most effective action you can take is to teach people what rape is and not do it, not police the behavior of women. If there's anything that women need to know its that it's okay to leave a situation they are not comfortable in, and they need to be taught that they don't need to be pleasant and polite to others. What clothes they wear and what streets they walk down are far less important things to worry about. In fact, women wearing the stereotypically 'slutty' clothes are less likely to be raped.

I don't see education regarding consent as being mutually exclusive to education about personal responsibility and risk taking.

I am *sick to goddamn death* of rape being treated as exclusively a female issue. It isn't.

I'm not for policing anyone's behaviour (unlike feminists, or their allies^(2)), I'm all for personal responsibility and individual agency. Everyone has an onus to assess risk to themselves and act accordingly, but that doesn't preclude the fact that bad things still happen to the well prepared as well as the unprepared. Everyone has the choice to obey the law and social standards or not. If a person chooses to rape, then they are wholly responsible for that choice and they should bear the consequences of that action - that isn't mutually exclusive to victims (or potential victims) taking responsibility for themselves, their conduct, and whatever factors they are or aren't responsible for in that situation.

Everyone should be aware not only when to GTFO, but when to not go in the first place. Personally, I think society would benefit from far more assertiveness across the board.

As for where people are, what they are wearing, and how drunk they are - this is one of the reasons that these kind of discussions are often both loaded and largely pointless. The largest class of rapes (in America anyway) is male on male rape in prisons, probably the rape of children by relatives and associates next, and likely followed by the rape of adults by relatives and associates. The 'epidemic' of date rape isn't if you count it by raw figures, and strangers grabbing you off the street is less common than being hit by a car.

&gt; So again, you're going to be giving bad advice. You're going to tell them how they should dress and where they should go, despite these not being correlated with an increase in rape.

Go to the party, get wasted, and make sure you're dressed like a ho, and remember, you're never responsible for what happens to you provided you've got a vagina and it's a sex crime? Fuck that advice.

The reality is that how you conduct yourself does influence how others treat you^(3). If there is a predator looking for prey, then they are very likely going to go for the most vulnerable person - so don't let it be you.

---

1) If a woman is drunk driving and crashes the car we hold her accountable for that. If she gets blackout drunk and makes stupid (but consensual) decisions regarding sex we automatically accept her word as an accusation of rape. Why the exceptionalism?

If a person is so intoxicated as to be unable to even remember if they consented or not, then as far as I'm concerned any claims of rape are entirely without merit (provided there is no other supporting evidence). The primary witness to the alleged crime isn't a credible witness, and if it were any other criminal complaint you wouldn't even be able to get the police to record it, let alone have it seen by a court. 

The other example of *no fault for women* that pisses me off is the weak or retroactive withdrawal of consent. The ""Yes Means Yes"" legislation is bullshit, if a person gives consent then the onus is on them to withdraw that consent unambiguously, not for the other party to constantly be asking whether they still consent. Additionally, the idea of retroactive withdrawal of consent is also bullshit, it turns everyone into a potential rapist even if they had full consent and acted completely above board, and it also makes a mockery of the experience of real victims of rape.

2) Feminist doctrine is all about enforcing a standard of behaviour from the top down. They don't want people to have agency or choice, they just want to force their thinking and their standard of acceptable behaviour to be the only option.

I believe that if you want to address behaviour then that must come from the bottom up to a large degree. People have to make their own commitment to acting and thinking in a particular manner, not be dictated to by self appointed guardians of a particular morality (especially where those people make no secret of the fact they despise those they most want to change).

3) Nobody's saying that the burka is the answer, but I believe there's merit in being aware of the message you are sending. 

It just seems to me that if you scream yes with every word and deed for a prolonged period then you are sending a message of consent, whether you ultimately are committed to that or not. People cannot read minds, and they don't tend to make their best decisions when they're drunk and horny either.

When it is something as important as avoiding rape, then I believe that your words, deeds, and presentation should all be in alignment with your intentions regarding consent. 

None of this justifies the act of rape. Rape is a crime. The problem is always the edge cases, even more so in rape because it so often boils down to the word of one person against another (which is another reason to not act like a coked out Lindsay Lohan in front of an entire room of people and then be shocked when they all question your credibility).

"The problem is that any kind of recommended actions to avoid rape are painted as victim-blaming and rape culture. See: [GHB-detecting fingernail polish.](http://www.newsweek.com/controversy-over-nail-varnish-date-rape-drug-detector-267126)

There are people that honestly believe and loudly advocate that nothing a victim does or did factored into the rape, and that they should have done nothing differently. 

To quote that article, 

&gt;“Whilst Undercover Color’s initiative is well meaning, on the whole,” she said, “Rape Crisis does not endorse or promote such a product or anything similar. This is for three reasons: it implies that it’s the woman’s fault and assumes responsibility on her behalf, and detracts from the real issues that arise from sexual violence.”

&gt;“For us, we work with victims to make them realise that they did nothing wrong,” she added. “Among primary cases, some do ask if they could have done anything to stop it. Products like this suggest otherwise. The emphasis must be placed 100% on the perpetrator.”

This is an asinine approach. There is a difference between ""did nothing wrong"" and ""could have done more"". If you get in a head on collision around an exit ramp with a drunk driver going the wrong direction, you did nothing wrong.

"&gt;Its an active form of aggression by a rapist.

Not always. Violent rape? Sure. Acquaintance rape? Most times, maybe, but some rape is the result of a misunderstanding on the part of the perpetrator. Sometimes the victim is too scared or drunk to say ""no"" clearly, and this results in a misunderstanding of consent. Here's an interesting TAM talk by Carol Tavris which addresses the issue: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SpVVsOUsLo "	cl7hh9s	t1_cl7fcjh	humans_are_good	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism. I'm not convinced that ""rape culture"" exists in a significant way, and I certainly don't believe that society is ""cultured"" to excuse rapists. **To clarify: I believe that ""rape culture"" hardly exists, not that it doesn't exist at all.** First of all, sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also, when people offer advice (regarding ways to avoid rape), the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy: a person is on a bus, and loses his/her phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not. I've noticed that often, when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes, people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact, when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago, my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course, rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However, where's the line between helpful advice and ""rape culture?"". I think that some feminists confuse these two, placing both of them in the realm of ""rape culture"". Personally, I do not think that victims of any serious, mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight. This is distasteful, especially after the fact, even if it is well meaning. However, I do not think that these warnings are a result of ""rape culture"". CMV! _____ &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"I'll level with you- I do think that there are possibly degrees to rape. But I also feel that these degrees go hand-in-hand about the idea of ""rape culture,"" a culture where rape is more able to fester and spread. Like for you drunk example- I think that we can at least agree drunk yes or a scared yes hold little to no weight for actual consent, but for some people this form of ""consent"" may seem viable. 

I recognize that there are going to be other situations where misunderstanding more to blame then the person, but you have to consider- this sample size of exceptions is starting to get smaller and smaller. And the one instance of ""a guy who was drunk, who had asperger's, who got a 'yes' that he misinterpreted,"" does not immediately erase the concept of rape culture nor it's apparent size.

"While I agree in general that ""rape culture"" does not exist in the way that is portrayed currently (men are NOT all participating in the support of rape!), there definitely are rape subcultures. They can range from creepy guys chatting online to frat boys and date rape drugs.

Personally, I think everyone would be far better to focus on the subcultures, while asking men in general to stand up against them. As it is right now, men who would never, ever, ever consider rape are being shamed because they are lumped in with the actual perpetrators.

"First, I must say that I did not and don't really intend to read that 25 page report.  

I must have misunderstood your original comment.  I thought you were under the impression that rape culture was suggesting that all men have potential to rape and are equally responsible for the rape that their gender commits.  I fully disagree with this.

I do agree with the author's argument that men have a collective responsibility.  It's their responsibility to call their friends out when they hear demeaning comments.  It's their responsibility to actively take an interest in learning how to recognize real consent verses a woman giving up.  It's not just the responsibility of men though to be vocal, it's part of being a good human.  If you hear someone planning to do something really horrible to someone else and the that person with the plan is someone you know, you'll call them on.  Don't pick that fight, one might say.  So in my opinion it's more of a societal (men included) responsibility to change the way we think about rape, to talk about consent and address the ways in which rape is happening in a very vocal way.

Further I believe both men and women have the responsibility to recognize how their work in entertainment or other media perpetuates the stereotypes that lead to people misunderstanding consent and how much to pursue a women.  If we took these casual elements of rape culture out of movies, of our everyday jokes, and actively tried to replace them with responsible, evolved relationships we would likely see a decrease in these rape behaviors happening.  Most men confused about what consent actually is don't know they're confused, don't want to be raping and if were truly educated and all their friends had moved on would not want to be left in the dark past raping women casually.  

What if it was cool to practice consent lines?  Like groups could sit around a circle (think just before spin the bottle) and take turns coming up with different lines and the group could all comment on whether it sounds like consent or not.  They could then discuss the grey areas.  What if this were a frat game?

"I haven't read through every comment, but I would like some clarification on a couple of things. 

My personal viewpoint on ""rape culture"" is that it exists, but it presents a few viewpoints that I think could be very helpful in preventing future crimes. Like I have read in several comments here, it often seem to be attempts (misguided or not) to find a reason as to why the rape occurred. Why is that a bad thing?

If I knew that there was a specific cul-de-sac that was largely inhabited by registered sex offenders/pedophiles, I would take every opportunity to keep my child from going anywhere near the area. 

If I lived in a bad part of town, known for robberies and theft, I would not walk through town with my iPod and Laptop in clear view. Or, if i did have these objects with me, I would take precautions in the event that something did happen. I might carry mace, a stun gun, maybe even an actual handgun (because of previous military training and experience).

I feel like walking into those situations, knowing that you're in a bad area, and not taking precautions against crimes you know could happen is, frankly, idiotic. It's just a crime waiting to happen. I do not think that a victim of a crime is to blame entirely for bad things happening. Obviously the perpetrator of the crime is at fault for committing the crime in the first place. But I feel as if allowing yourself to be in that situation should be frowned upon. If this was a common feeling, again, personal opinion here, I feel as if these crimes would dwindle to a measurable extent. 

Why is this considered the wrong mindset to have? Could someone explain this to me? I just seem to be missing something.

What you're saying suggests that these things will happen no matter what.  Why is it better (or okay only) to prevent being the victim of a crime as an individual than to prevent the type of crime from happening at all (by educating the public) on a societal level?  By clearing showing how this issue may be hiding from the public's conception of what rape is we can prevent people from committing acts that they have been taught by society and culture aren't wrong.

Or look to video game rhetoric:

""I'm going to rape you noob""

"The OP:

&gt; That ""Rape Culture"" does not exist in a significant way

People's attitude toward rape, in my mind, indicates the existence of rape culture.

I don't discount that violence against men and woman is treated differently. My point was that culture blatantly ignores (and almost celebrates) the rape of men (14 year old got raped by his teacher, ""good job bro!"") and people tend not to even notice. This leads me to believe that the much more subtle culture of rape toward woman (outlined throughout this thread) would go equally unnoticed.

It all adds up to a culture that functionally minimizes, deflects, and celebrates rape."	claxswz	t1_cladrs3	drglass	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

&gt; These long prison sentences are accepted by both men **and women**, and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments.

The prison sentences heavily discriminate against male perpetrators, and female perpetrators, and women, consequently do not receive long prison sentences for rape.  Furthermore, due to a definitional problem, female rapes are ""reclassified"" as other than rape (Made to penetrate).

"I have to agree that for the most part rape culture as used by most feminists I hear from is completely overblown, and for the most part does not exist.

That does not mean however that rape culture does not exist. It absolutely does, and it is found in prisons, and even to a lesser extent with regards to men in general. I have heard the exact same people for years who would bemoan the terrible rape culture in our society then go on to say they hope some criminal gets raped in prison. I think anyone being raped is reprehensible, no matter who that person is. The overwhelming majority of people in this country agree it is reprehensible as long as you are talking about a female, or to a lesser degree free males. When it comes to men in prison most people do not give a fuck, and even encourage it in many cases. That is the very definition of a rape culture."	cl7qvk6	t3_2j196u	QQueCueQueue	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"http://boingboing.net/2014/10/11/yet-another-female-game-dev-ta.html

This is the example of rape culture I saw in my Facebook feed today.  The harassers in this story have targeted violent rape threats to a successful woman who spoke out for women's rights in her professional field.

Think back to the recent Emma Watson scandal.  She spoke on woman's rights internationally and was threatened to have nude photos circulated online.  This turned out to be a hoax.  Yet, this is rape culture. 

This type of violent hate, using sex or body images as a weapon, against women who stand up for us all, is aimed to keep the rest of us in our places.  By sending the message clearly to the public that these guys will rape us if we demand equal rights is the clearest indication of rape culture I can think of.

"College campuses are one of the most dangerous places for women to be with respect to sexual assault and rape, yet schools have proven horrible at dealing with the issue in a matter respectful to the victims and just to the perpetrators. Ms. Magazine published an article last spring about it, and even I, a staunch feminist, was thoroughly shocked by the experiences of the girls that the story followed. I had similar thoughts of ""who really thinks rape is okay,"" but I did my homework and the answer was not as clear cut as I'd hoped. Now, improvements are being made on the college campus scene, to be sure, but currently they are a very good example of just what rape-culture means. Survivors of rape and sexual assault are discouraged by school administrations from reporting their experiences. Students reported to have committed sexual violence are being grossly under punished. In a personal story from the Ms. article, a young woman did not report her rape, but found out that her rapist had previously been found responsible by the university for a crime of sexual violence. His punishment was to watch a 23 minute educational video on sexual violence and write a two-page reflection paper. Later on, he was found guilty by the school for raping two more women, but the matter was mostly kept under wraps and the man still graduated with his diploma. I realize that this is only one case, but it's not just a fluke. A 2010 Center for Public Integrity report showed that only 10 to 25 percent of students found responsible for campus sexual assault are expelled. Even if we assume that it is a full 25 percent, that is still woefully low. A man can rape a woman and 3 times out of 4 suffer virtually no consequences? There is a minimum prison sentence for vehicular homicide while intoxicated. Now, death might be more permanent than rape, and drunk driving is, of course, a terrible choice to make, but a drunk driver does not intentionally seek to kill. A rapist, on the other hand, intentionally seeks to force themselves upon the victim, in such a way that this victim may never be able to live life the same way again. It should merit severe punishment. Yes, the laws regarding sexual assault and rape are adequately severe, but often times the legal system is avoided entirely, thanks to poor support systems for victims. That sounds like rape culture to me. Ms. asked women to share their stories regarding sexual violence on college campuses, and several shared direct quotes from conversations with their school administrators. An administrator at Amherst College used the phrase ""Are you sure it was rape?"". A counselor at UNC Chapel Hill said ""Rape is like a football, and you're the quarterback; when you look back on a game, Annie, how would you have done things differently?"" 6.4% of college men admitted to committing rape or attempted rape. 1 in 5 female college students will experience rape or attempted rape at some point in her time at school, and only 12% of those victims will report their experiences. Why? Because of responses like these. Because schools want to keep their rape numbers artificially low, and therefore create negative environments for survivors of rape and sexual assault to live in. In some contexts, rape-culture is easy to overlook, easy to chalk up to feminist imaginings, but it's there. Even with feminist consciousness-raising stripped away entirely, it's there."	cl7w4ix	t3_2j196u	cassidyy314	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"For me, the most compelling thing that illustrates that ""rape culture"" is a thing are the statistics.

&gt; Is 1 in 5 American women surviving rape or attempted rape considered a cultural norm? Is 1 in 6 men being abused before the age of 18 a cultural norm? ([TIME](http://time.com/40110/rape-culture-is-real/))

[Here is a much longer list of statistics if you are interested.](http://wearawhitefeather.wordpress.com/survivors/rape-culture-statistics/)

But if you want some compelling evidence that there is a ""rape culture""--that is to say that it is a subliminal cultural norm that rape is okay in certain circumstances, then you just have too look at what the children say:

&gt; In a survey of high school students, 56% of the girls and 76% of the boys believed forced sex was acceptable under some circumstances. (ref 5)

&gt; A survey of 11-to-14 year-olds found:

&gt; 51% of the boys and 41% of the girls said forced sex was acceptable if the boy, ""spent a lot of money"" on the girl;

&gt; 31% of the boys and 32% of the girls said it was acceptable for a man to rape a woman with past sexual experience;

&gt; 87% of boys and 79% of girls said sexual assault was acceptable if the man and the woman were married;

&gt; 65% of the boys and 47% of the girls said it was acceptable for a boy to rape a girl if they had been dating for more than six months. (http://www.uic.edu/depts/owa/sa_rape_support.html)

"The 1 in 5 number has been repeatedly debunked.  Here are three articles that addresses the topic, but there are numerous out there:

http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-1-in-5-women-have-not-been-raped-on-college-campuses/article/2551980

http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/3925/MythsGilbert.htm

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/01/one-in-five-women-in-college-sexually-assaulted-the-source-of-this-statistic/

The poll mentioned in the time article is The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey.  This is a relatively recent survey, so there aren't many articles out there analyzing the techniques used (at least not that I could find).  

From looking at the at the abstract,

http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=ss6308a1_e#Table1

you can see immediately that it is what is known a self-selective poll (sometimes called a 'slop' poll).  This is a survey that is made up of respondents who *choose* whether or not to participate, based on the subject of the survey, rather than a random sample.  Self selective polls are not scientifically sound and do not legitimately represent a population.

You can find a verbatim list of the poll questions here:

http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24726

and an archive here:

https://pdf.yt/d/dHGJ5JPA5oQ3a_GS

I noticed that one of the questions filed under Sexual Violence asked if the respondent had sex after someone pressured them by ""making promises about the future they knew were untrue"".  This would not fit most people's understanding of what rape or sexual violence is.  You have to keep this in mind when interpreting the results of a survey, especially one like this.

Most surveys require context and explanation to convey their findings honestly and accurately. Unfortunately, many media outlets will just throw it out there in a misleading fashion.  It is best to take a close look at the survey yourself so that you can avoid spreading misinformation like you have done here.

By that definition, I don't think there is a reasonable argument to be made that a national rape culture exists in the U.S., except in prisons. There is no ""epidemic"" of rape here, like many feminist rhetoricians suggest. Rape rates have plummeted by somewhere between 60 and 80% over the last thirty-five years (depending on whose statistical methodology you agree with), just like violent crime as a whole. Rape deservedly merits some of the harshest prison sentences handed down and virtually every serious person agrees that that's a good thing. With the exception of a few wacked-out republican politicians, the national dialogue about rape consists almost entirely of discussions on how to lower the rate even further. 

Anyway, my point is, if you can't joke about things without contributing to a destructive culture, then we also have a holocaust culture and a dead baby culture that need to be dealt with.

"I know several men and women who are survivors of rape. I know of many more. If this isn't pervaisive, it sure is close. There is plenty of normalization in the form of the ""boys will be boys"" argument, which sadly is still used, sometimes verbatim. See also: [This daily show clip](http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/5ndnit/jessica-s-feminized-atmosphere), Steubenville, politicians saying rape doesn't cause fertilization of embryos, and so much more. There is plenty of tacit toleration of rape in colleges and the military, where the victim is accused of lying, exaggerating, trying to ruin men's lives, and so forth. 

I agree with you on the necessity or benefits of humor, even when dealing with dark subjects. But there is a stark gulf between joking about dead babies and the violence of sexual assault. If you need me to shine light on those nuances, my faith in humanity has been misplaced. 

Just because you aren't looking for it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just because it isn't being reported, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just because you don't have to directly deal with the ramifications, doesn't mean it does not exist.

"&gt;So any trend that may tangentially increase the odds of circumstance x is now a part of x culture?

No? It's not a part of broader American culture because it increases the incidence of rape, it's a part of American culture because going to college is a social expectation for many people, many people do in fact go to college, and part of college life is the drinking culture. 

&gt;And isn't saying that rapes are caused by dudes being encouraged to drink to excess and get laid to prove themselves contrary to the generally accepted wisdom that the majority of rapes happen between people who know each other already, which is a cornerstone of our arguments against victim-blaming?

Not really. Plenty of people who drink together know each other beforehand. The 'stranger' in  'Stranger rape' doesn't mean 'we don't know each other that well,' it means, 'I had never met this person before they accosted me in a parking lot.'  Whereas acquaintance rape happens when some guy who is already interested in some woman pushes his advances so hard that he crosses the line of sexual consent. That's how most rape happens, and the fact that it happens that way is the reason why we have studies showing that many men who commit rape aren't aware that they in fact did so.

"&gt;Why not drunk driving culture? Why not straight up fight culture?

Sure, those are major problems, especially the former. But it's not a zero-sum thing and what's at issue in this thread is rape. Start another thread about drunk driving if it bothers you--seriously, it's a major problem.  

Look, these are all entrenched social and cultural problems. It's not like we can solve any of them by occasionally popping in and verifying that the problem is under control, like a leaky boiler or something. They cause emotional and physical harm on a massive scale every year. The fact that this is the status quo is itself a large part of the problem, and examining the cultural attitudes around rape (or drunk driving, etc.) is an eminently logical thing to do, especially since we don't have a single pinpoint cause about why the incidence is so high still. It's not like there's a convincing argument to be made for, 'no, let's tolerate _some_ rape.'

"There are jokes that are used to bring levity to dark situations that are remote, if still at all present. And then there are jokes that transmit social mores and expectations. These are jokes that implicitly condone rape in certain contexts. These are different than other 'tasteless' jokes, and not just because of the tone. There is subtext to every joke:

You deserved it if you go to jail, it's just a cost of being a criminal. It's an extra punishment that prevents crime.

"It does exist. Just not the one feminsts boast about. What happens in prison when an inmate gets raped? Staff turn the other cheek at best...at worst they encourage it as a means to keep certain inmates in check. The epidemic of prison rape is what started the term ""rape culture"" to begin with. Feminists borrowed it to propagandize rape hysteria in western culture.

It doesn't stop there. Little to no punishment when teachers rape their young male students. The first thing anyone asks is ""was she hot?"". In general, if a man does not consent to sex and the woman goes ahead anyway, most people don't consider it rape. ""He had an erection, therefore he wanted it"" are the usual types of comments even though an erection doesn't equal consent any more than a woman becoming wet while getting raped is consent. ""You didn't want it? What are you a faggot?"" and ""Men can't be raped, period"". Those are the mentalities of people who trivialize and justify rape. In other words, a rape culture. People only care when women are the victims to the point where even friends or family members of a man who was forced to have sex will not be on his side."	cl7viuj	t3_2j196u	ghebert001	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"The statement

&gt; Be careful, there are rapists out there. You should protect yourself by not dressing provocatively and getting home before dark.

is functionally equivalent to

&gt; Know your place, wench. Don't dare dress provocatively or go out at night, or else!

The only difference is whether the speaker is passively acknowledging an outside threat or making the threat himself.

I'm not saying that acknowledging real danger is *as bad as* making a threat, just that the former is partially guilty of the same offense as the latter: In both cases, the threat of rape is coercing women to conform to patriarchal expectations. Both speakers are saying (one implicitly, the other explicitly) that only women who fail to be quiet/chaste/""good"" get raped.

When ""There are rapists out there, you should protect yourself"" is a true statement that needs to be said, that's fine. But we are in a sorry state of affairs where well-meaning people offering valid self-protection advice are in fact indirectly furthering the agenda of sexist oppression via the threat of rape.

"It seems like people are getting hung up on the term itself and sort of shutting down on the conversation by getting defensive before hearing any explanation as to what constitutes the so called ""rape culture"". If it were called anything else, rape problem, rapedemic, overwhelming amount of rapes taking place, maybe it would be better received. 

This thread made me a little sick. It compared a crime that can destroy a person to having a bike stolen. It said that young women (or people in general, i'm not excluding men who are raped) should know better than to drink at parties or go to a bad part of town or wear something they deem provocative. I mean, what did they expect?! This is all perpetuating ""rape culture"". This line of thinking is the problem! Thinking that feminists are just blabbering on about something that doesn't really exists says so much about how women are viewed in our society.

"While women feel more vulnerable regarding violent crime, men are actually much more likely to be a victim of it.  

Rape culture? It actually does exist, but not in the way feminists use it.  Rape culture as a term was actually coined to describe the environment of sexual violence in prisons.  

And while most people in prisons are men, women are actually statistically more likely to be sexually assaulted by other inmates.

I say sexually assaulted, and not raped, because the definition of rape is such that it is impossible for a woman to do it without a strap on.  This gender-biased definition of rape is, like rape culture, another example of the politically-motivated social engineering to make people always perceive women as victims and men as perpetrators."	cl7h8rl	t1_cl7fysx	Raudskeggr	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"Late to this party, but here's my $0.02:

When a child is raped, men want to string the rapist up by the balls.  But when an adult woman is raped, many men are quick to rush to the rapist's defense, either by implying that the victim is lying or was somehow asking for it.  Specifically, that she consented and later regretted it.

When someone is robbed, we don't blame the victim or accuse them of lying about it.  But when a rape accusation comes out, it's often shot down immediately as untrue, exaggerated or financially motivated.  (See:  the current Bill Cosby debacle).  

People don't take into account how much shame, guilt and fear is involved in coming forward about being raped.  Instead, they do exact the opposite:  assume the victim is lying and rush to the perpetrator's defense.  It's a vicious cycle that actually makes it harder for victims to report rape.  

This is just as common in cases where the perpetrator(s) are 100% proven guilty, such as the Steubenville case, as it is in cases with less evidence.  Even CNN--a bastion of supposed liberalism--commented that the Steubenville rapists' ""[bright football careers were being ruined] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUdyNko8LQ)"" by the charges.  THEN MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE RAPED A GIRL AND BRAGGED ABOUT IT ON TAPE.  

Just take a gander at some of the online comments on rape stories and you'll see the pervasiveness of these attitudes.  This is ""rape culture"" at its ugliest."	cmgu0y0	t3_2j196u	Liz_B_Anne	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I agree that ""rape culture"" does not exist as feminism frames it.  

For one thing, look at all these one in four or one in five statistics from bogus studies with twisted methodologies where sex when both parties are drunk is considered rape (for women, not men).  

Then you have campus judiciary committees overseeing campus claims of rape wherein the standard of proof is a preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities -which means they need to prove there is 51% likelihood the act was committed.  So the accused is pretty much guilty until proven innocent.  I don't know why the standard of proof wouldn't be ""clear and convincing evidence"" -but why are these judiciary committees even necessary?  Call the proper authorities and let them investigate.  

Dr. David Lisak found in his 2002 study that 90% of campus rape is committed by repeat offenders, so to paint all men as potential rapists as feminist campaigns like ""Don't Be That Guy"" does, is not only unfair, it's sexist.

Also, false allegations do happen more often than people think and the repercussions for false accusers is very lenient. In fact, acts of sexual assault are hardly ever punished severely for women.  There are many examples of women committing statutory rape or abusing positions of authority (teachers, prison guards, etc...) and having sex with male inmates only to be let off the hook or get a slap on the wrist."	cl7tiqs	t3_2j196u	Rabbit_TAO	"I constantly hear about so called ""rape culture"" in regards to feminism.

"I think we should adopt an actual rape culture for a year for some fucking perspective.

Women refuse to take any responsibility for their actions. Admittedly, in this thread, in almost all posts trying to explain how rape culture works, the poster has cited that the large majority of rapes are not the violent, spread 'em or I'm going to kill you and your dog.
