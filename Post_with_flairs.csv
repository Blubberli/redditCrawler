CMV: The US consumption of famous people culture negatively impacts our nation.,iammagicbutimnormal,Removed - Submission Rule A,793,105,"Why does the US consume so much famous people culture? In particular, as a liberal, I dont know what other liberals expect from society when we glorify wealth and place value on sneakers over people. It is so clear that we have a very disturbing cycle of consumerism that includes famous people. ,There is something grotesque about the average citizen seeking constant public acknowledgment of self value, somehow channeled through the idolization of the wealthiest. By modeling the selfish, shallow, destructive behaviors of the wealthiest, along with whatever they are selling us, our society adopts these unhealthy behaviors in general as normal. I would say this juxtaposition happens across the spectrum from left to right or right to left. I was raised with conservative values and became a liberal in my adulthood. So here I sit with my conservative glasses and it poses a question to my liberal perspective.,¦I used to want to be a Hollywood movie star. I still love movie stars. I still love acting. But after reaching middle-age and having clawed and crawled and climbed my way to adulthood -with all my buddies on TV that have made me laugh or cry with their performances- I am hit with what feels like a realization the size of a grand piano. After Matt Laur, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, R. Kelly, Kevin Spacey, Louie C. K., and countless others -I realized that Hollywood/fame would have just used me and tried to suck my soul dry, chew me up and spit me out, over-used me until I was burnt out until I was burnt to a crisp as much as the real world does to the rest of us! Fuckin A!,This world is a monster to children and adults, and Hollywood is part of the Hansel and Gretel societal approach to harming children. Its none of my business. -Yes it is your business. Stop sexualizing children in media. Stop over sexualizing every aspect of our lives! But yet our society eats it up like its some sort of miracle life force. And in turn society cares nothing about the lives of others- they care most about the consumption of others. But when children and adults are harmed by societys gluttony of content no one wants to take any responsibility from the bottom to the top.  Its not my problem. Thats exactly like what anti-abortionist say about children that have been born. ,Well Hollywood, pedophilia is a serious problem in our society AND yours way up in the fluffy clouds of your glass houses. In fact, I think the over sexualization of children in media has played an integral part in this current real world problem we face. As a society we molded our culture to approve of constant sexual images from famous people, adopting their behaviors of caring about no one else but themselves and their immediate gratification, and the over sexualization of children and adults through those fame culture behaviors. ,The US and other first world countries are deeply immersed in an oligarchy governmental system, along a gradient of wealth. Jeffrey Epstein has proven that with his ties to the British monarchy, Trump, the Clintons, and a trove of Hollywood names. Thousands of A-B-C-D-E listers knew what was going on! R. Kelly has proven that. Harvey Weinstein has proven that. There are so many people, famous or political, that have proven that. Rich people can do whatever they want and get away with it. Our current oligarchy was built upon racism but is now a melting pot of classism. We are so deep into it that the cracks are starting to form. ,We think we love our famous people but we are realizing they dont give a shit about anybody! Seriously! You are disposable, like a used up battery! I do not wish to villainize everyone in Hollywood, but its widely known that thousands and thousands of famous people in the industry turned their backs on the subjugation and ostracization of the most vulnerable in society by their peers then decided to continue working with them for years. And people willingly put their children in the hands of a monster to line their own pockets, and some women chose money over their own dignity or that of women who would go after them. The cracks are forming and the light is shining through.,The value provided to society by the adoration of those most wealthy is extremely counterproductive to any realistic humanity we could learn to provide as an overall culture. We could use this knowledge and evidence in front of us to change our own priorities for the future of our children. Instead, all I see is more consumption and more its not my problem. Why are we so divided? What are we divided on? What basic principles do we agree upon? How can we mold value into society when we glorify terrible behavior?,Edit: The moderator said I had to explain my view better so here goes. We have 400,000 children presently living in foster care in the United States. These children are shuffled through strangers homes, they do not learn security, human connection, or have any advantages to make it as a grown-up. So what does society do when they grow up? We throw them away. We have multiple cities without drinking water in this country. We are possibly the richest country in the world and we have people that dont even have clean drinking water. We have toxins and chemicals being poured into our lakes and rivers. We have fracking that is creating earthquakes and leaving toxic chemicals in the ground we grow our food in. The over consumption of meat leads us to horrible livestock conditions for animals. Healthcare is unaffordable even for the middle class,Consumerism from so many angles is like squeezing blood from a stone. Corporate work conditions are inhumane and demanding, and the worker its left to deal with the over consumption of their energy and emotions. We are stripped of our dignity in this society no matter how hard we work. But still, we see pretty people on television and we focus on them instead of doing anything to improve the conditions around us. And what do celebrities expect from us? They want us to consume personalities or entertainment skills, theres also the products they are selling to make themselves richer and richer. Celebrities sell everything on TV from food to pharmaceuticals. Its like a cat and mouse game. There is no reprieve unless you get rid of social media and stop watching television. I would love for there to be a middle ground.,Our society is neglected and endangered, but I guess thats nobodys problem? Even when it has been shown that celebrities have harbored and aided monsters in their industry, our society continues to put them up on a pedestal and emulate them as if this is the ultimate way to live. There are so many regular people that would defend R. Kelly or Donald Trump from their horrific behaviors. Not only that, people think these behaviors should become normalized and accepted into the fabric of our society. ,The idolization of celebrity isolates us from those in our community by tying up our identity and our finances into emulating them and adoring them. It also breeds emotional dysregulation from all of the reality television that we can soon and then disseminate emotional dysregulation and unhealthy expectations of others in our own interpersonal interactions. It also masks the horrible nature of our systemic social and economic systems By creating an alternate reality in escapism. Does breeds apathy and actively harms the most vulnerable in our society."
CMV: The Chinese have no right to boycott.,ShadowX199,Removed - Submission Rule A,0,47,"Ive recently heard about Chinese people refusing to pay their mortgages until construction restarts.,Im part of the entitled millennial generation. (That owes a mortgage.) If you make a legal agreement to buy a plot of land, believing a house will be built on that land, you still owe payments towards that plot of land.,The Chinese who made the legal agreement to buy what they said they will buy need to do so. Or at least they need to make mortgage payments until they can find a clause that frees them.,If they dont? Then thats 100% their free will to go against the mortgage agreement they signed and they should get nothing.,(FYI, Im posting at 14:10. At 17:50 I am heading into a clean room where I do not have access to my phone other than on breaks. I will try to respond to replies on my breaks but it might be a bit.),Edit:,FYI: this is about the current event where a massive number of Chinese people congregated outside banks, demanding the money that they have paid towards mortgages back, saying they will stop paying them. ,They are doing this due to the company that was building the buildings (evergreen) stopped being able to make its payments and it snowballed."
"CMV: Feminism requires discourse, not a vacuum.",cougeeswagg,Removed - Submission Rule A,0,101,"If a feminist refuses to hear statistics and facts, they aren't a feminist worried about gender equality. They just want to be right.,Mental health for men is seen as a weakness, whereas it's embraced for women. Domestic violence happens to men, but it's seen as the man being weak, or he deserved it, rather than a crime. Same goes for sexual assault/harrassment, with ideas that he should be flattered/grateful. Men get harsher sentences than women, for the same crime. When these facts are brought up, then shot down by ""feminists,"" it's not about gender equality at that point. It's about getting preferential treatment by virtue of being a woman.,Edit: Just a thought that popped up in my head, as random thoughts are wont to do, if females/women have been 51% of the population, on average, how does the gender minority end up oppressing the gender majority? Genuinely curious."
CMV: vulnerable people can be radicalized by the left as much as the right with similar harms,erleichda70-,Removed - Submission Rule A,6,23,"We  agree that many people are becoming radicalized.  It used to happen in  person: meet someone new and your ideas can change a lot.  Charlatans  used this to con and worse.,We  agree that on-line forums exacerbated this significantly, right?  To the  point of shooters/violence/political disinformation campaigns.,What  I'm seeing lately are teens spending a whole heck of a lot MORE  time on forums seeking social interaction.  And out of this, I'm hearing  from parents about extremes regarding gender identity.  I've browsed  some of the absolute worst discord servers I've seen by any topic where  kids are being encouraged strongly in images, peer pressure and mental  manipulation.  I know there are valuable and supportive forums as well, however the existence of these other venues replicate many of the radicalizations commonly seen.  A thread seems to be identity seeking for those who feel lost.,If we argue the equivalency of various  radicalization I think it becomes a different discussion.  If we argue  which versions of hate or violence are better or worse, or which  externalities cause internal extremes in others we also go down a  different debate.  Not all right-wing extremes are violence, not all who  may become shooters do.  But the change in a person, the depth and  extent, are comparable.,Now, any  of this one could argue that the change in the person came from within.   But that too could be applied to issues labelled ""right"" as much as  ""left"".,My sister was also radicalized by the eating disorder world and  succeeded at it, dying at age 27.  So note that internal harms are not  devoid of mortal outcomes at all.  Suicide is also germane to all forms  of radicalization. ,Thus, let's call it: person changes who they are to an extreme due to time spent in a place online that appears to be the cause,We can't embrace that such a thing exists for one issue and not the other.

"CMV: Gender is not a ""social construct""",Appropriate-Fig-5171,Removed - Submission Rule E,83,501,"I still don't really understand the concept of gender [identity]* being a social construct and I find it hard to be convinced otherwise.,When I think of typical social constructs, such as ""religion"", they are fairly easy to define both conceptually and visually because it categorizes a group of people based not on their self-declaration, but their actual practices and beliefs. Religion is therefore a social construct because it constructively defines the characteristics of what it is to Islamic or Christian, such that it is socially accepted and levied upon by the collective. And as such, your religion, age, or even mood are not determinations from one-self but are rather determined by the collective/society. Basically, you aren't necessarily Islamic , you say you are.,Gender [identity]* on the other hand, doesn't match with the above whatsoever. Modern interpretations are , if anything, and the determination of gender is entirely based on an individuals perception of themselves. To me, this makes it more like an individual/self-expression as opposed to an actual social construct.,Ultimately, I don't have an issue with calling someone he/she/they or whatever, but it would be the same reason why I wouldn't really care to call a 60 year old a teenager if they prefer.,,*EDIT: since I didn't specify clearly, I'm referring to gender identity in the above. Thanks for the replies, will try to view them as they come."
"CMV: Western liberal media failed, Qatar World Cup was a success",The_Saracen_Slayer,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,26,"Well the time has come! Over a month ago, I made a post arguing why the 2022 Qatar FIFA World would succeed. That the western liberal media's fanatical journalists were blathering a bunch of nonsense. And that all their 24/7 hating news articles would have zero impact on Qatar and FIFA's success in hosting the World Cup. ,Women Lie, Men Lie, numbers do not. Lets see what they say:,Pre-World Cup stories, ""Qatar Cup a disaster"". Post-World Cup stories: ""World Cup 2022: In the end, Qatar Wins"" (Le Monde Dec 19, 2022), ""Qatar may see World Cup as a win..."" (NBC News, Dec 16, 2022).,So to change my view, show me what did I miss? What did all the controversy, boycotts and fanatical western journalists accomplish? All the people that didn't agree with my last post, what is your counter argument to these record breaking numbers now?"
CMV: gym sucks,Kcue6382nevy,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,23,"My family (especially my sister) has been telling me about that should go to the gym more because Im inside my room most of the time and to avoid getting fat, it makes me want to slap them in the face and punch them when I am told this but I cant because its not nice and I could get in jail. it feels like anyone that tells me to exercise (or be more determined on my life in general) is against me, it doesnt help that Ive been traumatized by bullying as a kid and that my generic makeup and mentality is different from most people. ,I think society put pleasure on people to make them be fit, besides I get all sweaty and dirty and the heat and exhaustion at times feels awful.,I dont know which is worse, become obese or exercise as much as you can but it affects nothing to my body other than exhaustion, there may be factors like that I keep eating junk food or that Im not eating as healthy as I should. ,I dont hate the gym, I guess I just hate being told that I should go to the gym and for some reason I keep saying yes when I must rather be at home relaxing,If anyone gives me a genuinely good reason why I should exercise more, I will try going 3 times a week"
CMV: Election Day should be moved to Veterans day.,StonesJonny,Removed - Submission Rule E,23,47,"For starters, November 11th is Armistice day for World War I. If World War I was truly the war to end all wars I could understand the significance of the November 11 date. But as we know, many wars came after. ,Memorial Day is similar to Veterans Day, as we too remember veterans on Memorial Day, and Memorial Days date fluctuates annually, its anywhere from May 25-May 31. ,Veterans Day can easily be moved to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, as there is no one perfect date to choose for Veterans Day, why not just make it Election Day? It reminds us of what veterans fought for, which includes the right to representation via voting. ,Election Day should be a federal holiday regardless, but instead of having two federal holidays in such close proximity, and having to have businesses/schools/towns adjust to such, it can all happen on the same day."
CMV: Social Security (FICA) tax is the worst tax in existence and should be completely restructured or eliminated entirely,quantik64,Removed - Submission Rule E,479,263," If you aren't wealthy you pay more in effective social security tax  i.e. FICA than someone who is wealthy,The social security tax (FICA) is the worst tax in existence and should either be completely eliminated and changed to a true flat/progressive tax. There are 3 main types of income tax (progressive, flat, and regressive) - listed in their order of terribleness.,Here is an example of each:,Person A is wealthier they make 400k,Person B is not quite as wealthy they make 150k,Under a progressive tax with brackets 10% (0-100k), 20% (100-200k), and 30%  (200k+),Person A who is in the 30% tax bracket pays 100k * 0.1 + 100k * 0.2 + 200k * 0.3 = 90k or ,Person B who is in the 20% tax bracket pays 100k * 0.1 + 50 * 0.2 = 20k or ,Govt collects 110k in taxes,As you see Person A who makes more money pays more in taxes. This makes sense and as they continue to make more taxes their tax rate will either asymptotically approach 30% (if that's the highest tax bracket) or get moved into an even higher bracket.,This one is very simple whatever the tax rate is everyone pays the same regardless of their income (sales tax is an example of a flat tax, also most state taxes tend to be - some pretend to be progressive but the highest tax bracket is like 7k+ so everyone is in it e.g. Georgia,With a 20% flat tax,Person A  pays 400k * 0.2 = 80k  or ,Person B pays 150k * 0.2 = 30k or ,Govt collects 110k in taxes,Ok this may seem more ""fair"" but as we know it isn't since most of us agree people who make more should pay more in tax so it really isn't as fair. But it's not the end of the world right? Just wait for a regressive tax,Suppose there is tax of 37% but it only applies to your first 150k of income,Person A pays 150k * 0.37 = 55.5k or ,Person B pays 150k * 0.37 = 55.5k or ,Govt collects 111k in taxes,Ok we can all agree this is unfair. Even flat tax advocates have to see this is incredibly unfair. This is effectively how social security (but wait it's even worse)...,So FICA which includes both Social Security and Medicare is a , tax paid to the federal government which everyone pays. It works exactly how the regressive tax outlined works. For example a single filer pays FICA tax on their first 142k in income.,Using the federal tax brackets and including FICA someone who makes 142k a year and is a single filer is in the 24% tax bracket. However since in the US the federal tax is a progressive system they effectively only pay , in taxes but with FICA that brings it to , In fact the income they earned between 40-140k was taxed at ,. However as stated above FICA is maxed out at 142k so income earned after that is not subject to FICA. The next 100k in income they earn they will have a lower effective tax rate than the effective tax rate they had from 40-140k.,But it gets even worse. We are assuming this person isn't self employed. The 7.65% you pay is only , of FICA generally your employer pays the other half but some aren't that lucky. For those who are self employed FICA is a whopping 15.3%. If this sad sap is self employed they will be paying more tax than those in the , federal income tax bracket. Simply unbelievable. A self employed worker make 60k a year has a , effective tax rate. Not to point fingers but that's more than the Biden's paid this year in federal taxes on 600k in jointly filed income (and likely more than Donald Trump and most other presidents for that matter).,In summary, FICA is absolutely shit and they should either completely restructure it to a flat or progressive tax, or get rid of it entirely. Being a young person in my 20s I doubt I will see a single penny paid into FICA given the direction things are going in this country - it's a complete travesty."
CMV: Cosmetology schools should be required to teach about textured hair,SpicyWhiteDress,Removed - Submission Rule E,74,65,"So for those of you who dont know, traditional hair dressing schools typically only teach styles and looks for people of European descent. All the modules they cover mainly focus on how to style and color straight-wavy hair types, and they do not cover how to properly treat and style textured hair. The only thing they teach about textured hair is how to straighten it, which is basically useless because not everyone who has textured hair goes to a salon just to get it straightened. ,If being a hairdresser is ones job, why would they not be required to learn how todo all types of hair? Why would they only need to know how to work with a specific races hair type and not all races? If you want to learn how todo textured hair, you either need to teach yourself or attend additional or advanced programs that are specifically for textured hair. I dont think this is fair because why not just cover it in regular beauty school? Yea textured hair can be more difficult to work with but like I mentioned before, if youre going to school for hair then you should be responsible for learning about ALL hair. ,Another reason I think this should be taught is because I feel like not teaching it breeds segregation in the hair industry. Being a black female with curly textured hair I can speak from experience on this one. I cannot go to white salons because they do not know how todo my hair, and Ive had some salons just flat out refuse to take me. If I want to get my hair done, I have to go to a black salon and I dont even see a reason as to why we need black and white hair salons. Isnt this the literal definition of segregation? If Hair schools would just teach about textured hair this would not be a problem anymore as I could walk into any salon knowing that they know how to work with my hair type. Working with black hair should be a part of the normal not considered a specialization.,Im posting this here because im genuinely curious to see what others think and to learn if there is actually a good reason why cosmo schools dont need to include textured hair in their curriculums."
"CMV: If you died from taking a pressed pill that you thought was a pharmaceutical but it contained fentanyl, you didn't die of a ""drug overdose"", you were poisoned.",BTM23,Removed - Submission Rule E,827,280,"Think about a college student who takes an Adderall a few times per year as a study aid.,Or a single parent who takes Xanax for a few weeks to help them cope with the emotions of divorce.,Or someone with PTSD who takes Ambien to help them rest.,These are legitimate pharmaceuticals that are fairly well-known and , to anyone who has ever had a prescription for them, or anyone who has been close to someone who had/has a prescription for them.,Sometimes, for any number of reasons, a person who has a physician-approved medical necessity for these pills may be unable to obtain them through the standard legal channels... Maybe the college student has been so busy that he missed his last doctor's appointment for a refill. Maybe the single parent canceled their health insurance so they could start paying rent. And maybe the PTSD sufferer simply can't afford the prescriptions this month.,When someone receives a controlled medication without a valid prescription, it's illegal, period. Whether it's from a fellow college student, a meth-head in the worst part of town, or it's just handed to them at a party, they're all the same in the eyes of the law. And I believe that's necessary to discourage recreational use and abuse.,In other words, when someone shoots themselves, it's a suicide. When someone accidentally shoots themselves with a gun they're handling incorrectly, it's an accidental death. When someone is shot by someone else, it's manslaughter or murder. Why is it different with deaths from fentanyl?,I believe the reason that most middle-class white-collar families don't realize or understand the fentanyl problem is because when they hear someone died of a drug overdose, they assume the person was an addict and picture them snorting, smoking, or shooting up to get high. That's what most people think when they hear the term ""drug overdose"" unfortunately.,Look, if I shoot up heroin or smoke meth, then I know the risks. I know this stuff was made by a crackhead in their backyard. There's no telling what it could be laced with or what it could do to me - and that's been true for decades, long before the fentanyl epidemic. I'm not saying these people deserve to die AT ALL, but they are choosing to put a substance in their body that they KNOW is home made, unregulated, and dangerous. They know it's a calculated risk (whether or not an addiction overshadows their ability to make that decision is irrelevant to the greater argument here).,But in the case of pressed pills that are , containing fentanyl, the ""drug overdose"" label seems like quite a stretch - they died from taking a SINGLE PILL that looks IDENTICAL to the pressed pills that come from their pharmacy. Regardless of how the victim obtained the pill(s), they were , They thought they got Adderall because it looks just like the Adderall they got from their pharmacy a couple months ago. There was no perceived risk.,If I buy some Kool-Aid packets from the flea market, I'm sure I've broken a law or two by buying an individual retail product not labeled for resale and without its original retail packaging, but that doesn't change the fact that I believe that it's Kool-Aid because it's in a paper packet that looks identical to the Kool-Aid packet I buy at the grocery store. So if that Kool-Aid contains fentanyl and it kills me, did I die of a drug overdose? The fact that it contained something deadly isn't diminished just because the Kool-Aid was obtained illegally."
CMV: I should support Nuclear energy over Solar power at every opportunity.,hebxo,Removed - Submission Rule E,"1,931",679,"Nuclear energy is cheap, abundant, clean, and safe. It can be used industrially for manufacturing while solar cannot. And when people say we should be focusing on all, I see that as just people not investing all we can in Nuclear energy. ,There is a roadmap to achieve vast majority of your nation's energy needs. France has been getting 70% or their electricity from generations old Nuclear power plants.,Solar are very variable. I've read the estimates that they can only produce energy in adequate conditions 10%-30% of the time. ,There is a serious question of storing the energy. The energy grid is threatened by too much peak energy. And while I think it's generally a good think to do to install on your personal residence. I have much more reservations for Solar farms. ,The land they need are massive. You would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor. ,The land needs be cleared, indigenous animals cleared off. To make way for this diluted source of energy? If only Nuclear could have these massive tradeoffs and have the approval rating of 85%.,It can be good fit on some very particular locations. In my country of Australia, the outback is massive, largely inhabitable, and very arid. ,Singapore has already signed a deal to see they get 20% of their energy from a massive solar farm in development. ,I support this for my country. In these conditions, though the local indigenous people on the land they use might not. ,I think it's criminal any Solar farms would be considered for arable, scenic land. Experts say there is no plan to deal with solar panels when they reach their life expectancy. And they will be likely shipped off to be broken down, and have their toxins exposed to some poor African nation. ,I will not go on about the potential of Nuclear Fusion, or just using Thorium. Because I believe entirely in current generation Nuclear power plants. In their efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. ,Germany has shifted from Nuclear to renewables. Their energy prices have risen by 50% since then. Their power costs twice as much as it does for the French. ,The entirety of people who have died in accidents related to Nuclear energy is 200. Chernobyl resulted from extremely negligent Soviet Union safety standards that would have never happened in the western world. 31 people died. ,Green mile island caused no injuries or deaths. And the radioactivity exposed was no less than what you would get by having a chest x-ray. ,Fukushima was the result of a tsunami and earthquake of a generations old reactor. The Japanese nation shut down usage of all nuclear plants and retrofitted them to prevent even old nuclear plants suffering the same fate.,I wish the problems with solar panels improve dramatically. Because obviously we aren't moving towards the pragmatic Nuclear option. ,I don't see the arguments against it. That some select plants are over-budget? The expertise and supply chain were left abandoned and went to other industries for a very long time.,The entirety of the waste of Switzerland fits in a single medium sized room.

(I was extremely religious when I was younger but I've toned that down now) This still partially contributes to my resentment but it's not the prime reason any more.,Now I primarily resent it because of how it's contributed to the stereotype of Southeast Asian women wanting rich old foreigner husbands, and because of how unfair it feels.

They have all ended up talking about how immature and neglectful they find men of their own race, which in my opinion is an unfair and racist generalization, while still praising foreigners, usually white men old enough to be their grandparents, as being the ultimate gentlemen. For what it's worth mentioning, they're still treated condescendingly sometimes, but they'd rather be treated like a pampered pet (as white men seem to treat them), than a dusty neglected trophy (as Asian men seem to treat them).,I know it's unfair for me to think and feel this way.

CMV: Medicare For All isnt socialism.,johnmangala,Removed - Submission Rule E,"4,446","1,052","Isnt socialism and communism the government/workers owning the economy and means of production? Medicare for all, free college, 15 minimal wage isnt socialism. Venezuela, North Korea, USSR are always brought up but these are communist regimes. What is being discussed is more like the Scandinavian countries. They call it democratic socialism but that's different too.,Below is a extract from a online article on the subject:I was surprised during a recent conference for care- givers when several professionals, who should have known better, asked me if a single-payer health insurance system is socialized medicine.The quick answer: No.But the question suggests the specter of socialism that haunts efforts to bail out American financial institutions may be used to cast doubt on one of the possible solutions to the health care crisis: Medicare for All.Websters online dictionary defines socialism as any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.Britains socialized health care system is government-run. Doctors, nurses and other personnel work for the countrys National Health Service, which also owns the hospitals and other facilities. Other nations have similar systems, but no one has seriously proposed such a system here.Newsweek suggested Medicare and its expansion (Part D) to cover prescription drugs smacked of socialism. But its nothing of the sort. Medicare itself, while publicly financed, uses private contractors to administer the benefits, and the doctors, labs and other facilities are private businesses. Part D uses private insurance companies and drug manufacturers.In the United States, there are a few pockets of socialism, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, in which doctors and others are employed by the VA, which owns its hospitals.Physicians for a National Health Plan, a nonprofit research and education organization that supports the single-payer system, states on its Web site: Single-payer is a term used to describe a type of financing system. It refers to one entity acting as administrator, or payer. In the case of health care . . . a government-run organization  would collect all health care fees, and pay out all health care costs. The group believes the program could be financed by a 7 percent employer payroll tax, relieving companies from having to pay for employee health insurance, plus a 2 percent tax for employees, and other taxes. More than 90 percent of Americans would pay less for health care.The U.S. system now consists of thousands of health insurance organizations, HMOs, PPOs, their billing agencies and paper pushers who administer and pay the health care bills (after expenses and profits) for those who buy or have health coverage. Thats why the U.S. spends more on health care per capita than any other nation, and administrative costs are more than 15 percent of each dollar spent on care.In contrast, Medicare is Americas single-payer system for more than 40 million older or disabled Americans, providing hospital and outpatient care, with administrative costs of about 2 percent.Advocates of a single-payer system seek Medicare for All as the simplest, most straightforward and least costly solution to providing health care to the 47 million uninsured while relieving American business of the burdens of paying for employee health insurance.The most prominent single-payer proposal, H.R. 676, called the U.S. National Health Care Act, is subtitled the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act.(View it online at ,) As proposed by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), it would provide comprehensive medical benefits under a single-payer, probably an agency like the current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare.But while the benefits would be publicly financed, the health care providers would, for the most part, be private. Indeed, profit-making medical practices, laboratories, hospitals and other institutions would continue. They would simply bill the single-payer agency, as they do now with Medicare.The Congressional Research Service says Conyers bill, which has dozens of co-sponsors, would cover and provide free all medically necessary care, such as primary care and prevention, prescription drugs, emergency care and mental health services.It also would eliminate the need, the spending and the administrative costs for myriad federal and state health programs such as Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. The act also provides for the eventual integration of the health programs of the VA and Indian Health Services. And it could replace Medicaid to cover long-term nursing care. The act is opposed by the insurance lobby as well as most free-market Republicans, because it would be government-run and prohibit insurance companies from selling health insurance that duplicates the laws benefits.It is supported by most labor unions and thousands of health professionals, including Dr. Quentin Young, the Rev. Martin Luther Kings physician when he lived in Chicago and Obamas longtime friend. But Young, an organizer of the physicians group, is disappointed that Obama, once an advocate of single-payer, has changed his position and had not even invited Young to the White House meeting on health care.

CMV: Psychosomatic disorder is a possible explanation for long covid,uniqueperson22,Removed - Submission Rule E,3,24,"I have some trepidation in posting this. To be clear, I in no way want to suggest that people who are suffering long covid arent genuinely ill or that their symptoms are in their head. Psychosomatic disorders are very real and cause very real illness, with very real symptoms. The brain is an organ, and any organ can be the source of serious medical problems!,Part of the reason I hold this view is that I think psychosomatic disorders are under recognized and psychosomatic explanations are too often brushed aside by patients and activists,Given all of the attention that covid has received, it would be very surprising if NOBODY had psychosomatic disorders related to the experiences of living through the pandemic and then actually catching covid. I know that there are many other lines of research into the mechanisms behind long covid, and this is a very new disease so it is clearly too early to know exactly how it interacts with the body. My position is simply that psychosomatic origins are one among the many possibly causes that might result in long covid. I havent heard anyone talking about this and I dont know if thats because theres some simple reason it cant be involved as a cause, or if thats because saying something is psychosomatic is so often perceived as a way of denigrating or dismissing real illness (again, it shouldnt be!)."

CMV: reserve prices on online auctions don't make sense,DoNotCensorMyName,Removed - Submission Rule E,7,16,"Reserves are a minimum price that bids must reach in order to be sold, on top of whatever the bidding starts at. This wastes everyone's time by making them attempt to bid amounts that the item won't be sold for. Bidding should start at the minimum price with no secret higher price. This is especially true on websites in which bidders don't necessarily pay what they bid. For example, an auction starts at $1, if bidder A bids $10, bidder B bids $100, and bid increments are $1, bidder B will win and pay $11. In a live auction, bidder B would pay $100 under the same conditions. Here, a reserve makes sense as it encourages bidders to bid high to meet the reserve. But for online auctions, one can bid small increments until they meet the reserve, and even if they do bid high, they still only pay the next increment up from the next lowest bid or the reserve, whichever is more. Any benefit of the reserve is completely lost in this format."
CMV: People talking about women's bodily autonomy in regards to abortion are messed up.,Beezertheturnip,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,127,"Before I begin with the substance of my argument, let me get a few things out of the way.  ,1) I do not have any firm policy level notions about abortion. The whole thing is a mess and I certainly don't think I have a better answer than anyone else.,2) I think that bodily autonomy is extremely important. This applies to both women and men.,3) I am male.  ,But to me, the often repeated line of argument that abortion is justified because of a woman's right to do as she pleases with her body is extremely unpersuasive. We impose limits on bodily autonomy all the time in our society, and most of us don't see any issues with it.  My, or anyone else's right to swing his or her arms around stops the moment that arm crushes a baby's neck. And outside of a very few people, we do NOT say that woman's rights to bodily autonomy justify infanticide. But the only serious difference between abortion and infanticide is that in the latter, we all agree that the infant is a human life, worthy of the same protections other human lives get, whereas for a fetus, these questions are not clearly agreed upon.  ,Quite simply, with the aforementioned exception of people who think that infanticide is also okay, (And these people are generally outside the mainstream debate about abortion) there is nobody who agrees with both of the following statements  ,A) Women's rights towards bodily autonomy allow for abortion,B) The fetus at the time of abortion being argued for is a living human being.  ,B effectively swallows up A, it's the larger issue, and I think most of us are in agreement that murder is a bad thing. Therefore, the issue around whether abortion should be permissible or not, and at what fetal ages it should be permissible, centers almost entirely around at what level of development you stop having a blob of cells and when you have a person. Blobs of cells can be destroyed without much thought or consequence. People cannot be destroyed outside of a very few specific cases.  ,I get the impression, however, that most people do not agree with this framework. I'm sure some of the people talking about women's bodily autonomy are doing so tactically, as a way of convincing others to adopt more permissive stances towards abortion. After all, somewhat dry analyses as to when exactly life starts do not inspire the most ardent sorts of passion, and the people most directly involved are too young to be able to express their opinions.  But I don't think all of it is such. Consider the prevalence of feticide laws, which prescribe legal penalties far closer to murder than simple assault if someone other than the mother destroys the fetus. Now I realize that in a representative democracy, laws generally are formed with some sort of tug of war between competing ideologies and whatever the final result comes out to be probably reflects none of their positions, but almost everyone I've ever spoken to on the subject in meatspace is aghast at the notion of someone other than the mother aborting the fetus if the mother wants to keep it, and does think of it as murder.  ,To me, that sends a rather warped message of ""Yeah, the fetus is alive, and a human that can be murdered and deserves societal protection, but if the mother wants to kill it well, that's her right."" I might be misrepresenting or misunderstanding this sort of position, but deep down I don't really think I am.   ,Anyway, that's my spiel, feel free to tear into me now. But let's keep it civil, if we can."
CMV: It should be easier to remove problem students from the learning environment.,Aruthian,Removed - Submission Rule E,827,301,"My understanding is that theres a ton of bureaucracy when it comes to removing students from the learning environment mainly due to No Child Left Behind. That is, you need to prove various interventions are not working. All this takes time/energy/resources away from other students who are in the class to learn. ,Ive worked as a sub and it seems like theres pressure to avoid removing students because it might mean I cant control the class or students so its my fault. ,Also, there seems to be a choice of prioritizing a few high needs students at the expense of many students. That is, suppose one student is disrupting the class. Removing the one student makes the rest of the class run extremely smoothly. However, doing so seems taboo. It kinda makes me think of an accusation Ive heard that k-12 education is focusing on catch up or the bottom students, rather than the middle of high end students. ,I may not be super educated in this field but this is my current view."

Death rate is effectively 0%. (,).  The ultimate goal is NOT to stop the spread of the virus (we're infected with viruses all time without noticing), but it's to prevent deaths, and to a lesser extent, suffering.,So at this point, the only solution is to spread the virus among the unvaccinated as quickly as possilb eto reach herd immunity as quickly as possible? Yes, there will be deaths, but deaths among people who chose to put themselves in that situation.

CMV: Superman is a completely uninteresting character.,spaceraingame,Removed - Submission Rule E,"2,090",291,"He's perhaps the most OP comic book character ever, and certainly the most OP mainstream superhero of all time. Nothing can kill him, except for some obscure glowing green rock. So there's essentially no tension when he's fighting his enemies because you know he's gonna win, and never have to fear for his life or safety. He has a grab bag of nearly every power--super strength, flying, x-ray vision, super speed, laser vision--you name it, he's got it. That's so uncreative, there's almost nothing special or unique about him. He just has it all, which makes it almost redundant for him to be in the Justice League (he has most of the other members' powers and is stronger than all of them combined). He has little to no personality, or at least a very boring one, and is such a bland and unrelatable character. Even when I was a little kid and had no standards at all, Superman still didn't interest me. I always watched the Batman, Spider-Man, X-Men and Justice League cartoons, but always skipped the Superman cartoon. I just didn't care for it. That's why there hasn't been a good live-action Superman film since 1978, despite all the other big-name superheroes (Batman, Spider-Man, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, Captain America, X-Men, etc.) each having fantastic movies within the past decade. That really says a lot."
CMV: The President of the United States is inciting violence with stochastic terrorism.,anonymous_agama,Removed - Submission Rule E,71,142,"Stochastic terrorism is the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted.,Trump has said direct quotes such as Second Amendment people could ""do"" something about Hillary Clinton,As well as the recent quote, Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,"" he added.

Violence follows these statements. Just look at the Proud boys reaction to that statement, reaffirming that they are standing by. This is the definition of stochastic terrorism. Especially when he knows hes doing it. ,Of course there have been violent acts committed by people on both parts of the political spectrum, but Trump is denouncing it on the left and simultaneously encouraging it on the right. Therefore we know he isnt actually concerned with stopping violence, but using it to his advantage. Hes a moron and an asshole but he does know his base. He knows what he is doing."
"CMV: The usage of the term ""LatinX"" is culturally imperialist and likely racist.",TheBestAtNothingness,Removed - Submission Rule E,171,76,"I  believe Americans who utilize this term are engaging in the act of  cultural imperialism. The racism aspect of it is more nuanced, however.,For starters, the English language already has a neutral to describe Latinos, it's Latin(s)/Latin people(s). Similar to American or  Dominican.  There are no calls for ""American"" to be made gender neutral,  as it already is. Why not utilize an existing word that already  describes the demographic in question?,Spanish/Portuguese  also have a neutral already, it's Latino. It serves as both the  masculine and the neutral. Grammatically that might seem strange to an English speaker, but that's the reality of those languages, they are  naturally gendered and that's how they're structured (though not  always). I am in complete support of Latin American-made initiatives to change this, such as the recent utilization of ""Latines"" in various  universities (hopefully other institutions soon as well!) in Rio de Janeiro.,Bear with me as I  maneuver this; Americans appropriated the words Latino from Spanish/Portuguese to invent a new category of people in the 90s,  (Hispanic was invented in the 80s, so I guess Brazilians didn't exist  before the 90s haha) and ignored half the meaning and utilization of the word. This is likely to be from ignorance and we shouldn't throw people under the bus for ignorance, but isn't that what the bad  type of appropriation is regardless? Appropriation in ignorance? Likely, the term was appropriated by the government to separate white/black Central/South Americans from North Americans. (speculation, not really  part of the scope of this but I'd be interested on your take.) This is  the racism bit.,So, they appropriated the word Latino, and then made up ""LatinX"". LatinX was created to be inclusionary and neutral. But they ignored that word they appropriated also is used as a neutral, all the while forgetting that their language already has a neutral.,As a first  generation immigrant who is active in my community here in the states, and I know this is  anecdotal, but I've only ever seen white people and 2nd/3rd generation Latinos (i.e. culturally American) use LatinX. I'm not one for gatekeeping of course, but 2/3 generations down there's always a certain level of assimilation. I believe it's a very offensive term. Many of my fellow 1st generation immigrants agree. Again, anecdotal. I'm sure there are plenty who think it's fine.,TLDR;,In conclusion, it just feels like the good ol' American cultural  imperialism, pushing whatever they believe to be correct onto other countries/cultures/languages, even if indirectly. A possible other  explanation is that in an effort to find ""representation"", third  generation Americans with little knowledge of their linguistic heritage have decided to use the imported ""Latino"" from Spanish/Portuguese,  ignoring it's original meaning in it's own language, using the word as masculine only for some reason, and then changing it to LatinX to be gender neutral as the word they appropriated didn't suit them anymore, all the while ignoring that the gender neutral word ""Latin"" already exists in English.,P.S.  I can only speak on Spanish/Portuguese as these are the ones that I speak myself, sorry for any grammatical mistakes.,,Edit: For some more context, Latino was derived from Latinoamericano. There's some speculation that Napoleon straight up invented THAT term when he went to war against now Mexico. Also, I don't know if I'm allowed to post links here, but there's a very interesting article discussing the invention of Hispanic/Latino for the purposes of the distinction of peoples. Obviously don't take it as fact if you find it, but its an interesting read with interesting conclusions.,Edit2: Removed the word ""white-washed"" from describing 2nd/3rd generation Americans as it is needlessly inflammatory as other people have suggested. That was my bad. I was just trying to highlight the differences between the different generations as important distinctions. Of course, I will have a different set of problems regarding my identity as a 1st generation than a 2nd/3rd (onwards) generation immigrant who deals more with the duality of both American and X cultures."
CMV: Professional critic SHOULD be harder to please than the average viewer and getting upset about it is missing the point of having professional critics.,LOUDNOISES11,Removed - Submission Rule E,854,163,"Putting aside how all reviews are opinion based, I think there is an expectation among many media die-hards that professional critics should reflects the tastes of the average viewer. Or that they are out of touch and therefore bad critics if they have a vastly differing levels of appreciation for something than the masses do.,In contrast, , a professional critic's function is the be more rigorous than the average viewer, ie: more critical. I think the appropriate expectation is, and always has been, that critics are harder to please by virtue of the fact that they spend their professional lives weighing up and reflecting on media in a way that most people don't and that their tougher standards are a built in and intentional out come of that process.,In other words, they should be harder to please. They set a higher bar and provide a different and therefore worthwhile perspective as a result. They are supposed to be separate from common opinion by default, because they represent a different, more stringent set of expectations. Their function is to show us how the well the movie/show did with the , as opposed to the casual viewer. These are supposed to be two very different 'scores' because they represent two very different approaches to film.,Being shocked or angered by harsher reviews from critics is like being shocked that cows are producing milk. I belief they're performing their function and that people those who call them hacks for having high standards are mixing up the function of critics with the function of their own peers and aggregate sites, ie: telling you what normal people felt about the film. This why sites like Rotten tomatoes keeps audience and critic score separate to begin with. Yet, people point to the discrepancies between them as if they're proof that the critics are bad at what they do.,Background:,I posted because I'm seeing a lot of people complaining about reviews for Netflix's The Witcher. This was spurred by some critics not watching the whole series before review (which i agree is bullshit), but has become the standard ""critics are dumb for being more critical than me"" thing in a lot of places. I'm a big Witcher fan (books and games) I like the show a lot, but it has huge flaws that would be hard to ignore if you weren't as 'in' as I am when comes to this show Witcher. Its really annoys me that so many fans are turning an argument about specific bad critics into a statement about critics in general. I know this is a very old view, but i think the focus on the unique role of critics as opposed to the subjectivity of critique is an angle that makes this post worth making."
CMV: Academic Success at Colleges Do A Poor Job At Addressing Deficiencies Necessary for Each of its Students to Succeed In Their Journey Through College.,leewilliam236,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,22,"This is all from my perspective.,All colleges expect you to know the fundamentals of organizing, time management, study skills, etc. in high school (including your AP/IB courses). It's straightforward to attend a workshop, set up a meeting, etc. whenever one feels like they're having a difficult time in time management for example. However, in order to implement the things you've learned in that workshop, you're going to have to apply them which can be pretty daunting for me. On top of that, they're offered during the semester, and it's expected that each student has a set plan for what you have to do to take care of your academics because studying requires a significant amount of time per day. Something that all students have to budget their time for. This means that it may take longer to see if the results are working as expected. I've taken classes that are required for a software engineering degree and have been getting low test scores. I didn't get a sufficient amount of sleep, feel confident in passing the test because I didn't have a study plan, how to read a math book, how best to review the material, etc.. I wanted to ask my Academic Advisor about how to do well in my classes because I wasn't doing as well as I should be and the only thing she did was to give me a bunch of timesheets and that's it. Like, what kind of advice and help is that? I could go to subreddits such as , or , for help but I don't believe it is best to radically take of the redditors' advice all at once. I think the best solution for these type of people is going through a MOOC. The class would give them a chance to gain the fundamental skills needed for academic success and find out what works best and what doesn't work best for them. That way, they would be comfortable to do things that most of the successful students are doing. It way better than just clicking on random articles and links that shows you tips of what works and what doesn't work.,I have such disdain for all these people working in there and personally would celebrate their demise for their absolute negligence. They have done nothing to help me at all and I personally find it hard to believe that ANYONE would find their advice valuable."

However, in recent days I was thinking that maybe our personality and intelligence are somewhat genetically predisposed?,For example, individuals who are affected by severe psychological disorders or mental health problems often have a family history of similar issues; and parents with high intellectual abilities are more likely to have children with higher IQ.,I used to think that environmental factors play an important role in shaping personalities and IQ, but I observed that sometimes newborn babies react differently to the same situation, and so do adults.

This is not to suggest it is not real or we are simulated or something...just that it is an illusion, not what is seems to be and we can't escape that illusion as a human.,Yes, even as I say this I recognize the paradox of me making this claim because it also not the absolute but my perceived version of it, but that doesn't imply it can't highlight the lack of absoluteness in another claims since the perception of a concept can disprove the absoluteness of another. For example, what we experience as an apple, isn't the apple's true absolute form, but seeing it as an apple we can assert with much confidence that we do not see it as a cellphone, and therefore it is truly not a cellphone."

A dance account is just that- a dance account (and I'm not even a fan but cmon she's 16 and that shit was brutal). ,I could extend this to other topics as well. Would you be asking for Ariana Grande to advertise for a good cause in the middle of a performance? No!

This is unprofessional behavior.",Defiance42,Removed - Submission Rule E,"1,088",706,"I am an undergraduate student and today I walked into my class that the teaching assistant was leading to find that he was wearing a t-shirt with the words ""Friends Don't Let Friends Vote Republican"" written on it, along with a picture of an elephant with a dunce cap. Now, I don't consider myself to be a Republican (though I do sometimes vote Republican, depending on who's running), so this didn't bother me too much personally, but it did strike me as unprofessional and inappropriate for a TA to be wearing. ,I know that college campuses are relatively laid-back work environments, especially for students with teaching jobs (as most TAs are), but I do think that wearing explicitly political t-shirts, and more specifically ones that put down those with other political views, is inappropriate, even in this context. I think this is particularly true when the person in question is in a position of authority over others, like a TA and his students. ,Edit: To clarify my viewpoint, I do not think that the TA shouldn't be allowed to wear this t-shirt, or that he should be fired, or suffer any other negative consequences. I merely think that his choice to wear it was unprofessional and inappropriate given the context. I am not ""offended"" or ""upset"" by the fact that he wore the t-shirt, I merely think it was an unprofessional decision, but am open to having my view changed, which is why I posted in this sub."
CMV: Bitcoin can't be the world currency while America is a global superpower,yourgrassisass,Removed - Submission Rule E,9,35,"America's power is tied to the dominance of the US dollar as the world's most trusted currency. If Bitcoin ever truly threatens to dethrone the US dollar, it would pose such a huge threat to US supremacy that it's virtually certain that the US government and banks would use all means necessary to stop it.,Bitcoin, like any currency, works only when people trust in it. Taking it down merely requires sowing chaos and distrust. That kind of sabotage is child's play for the US government.,For example, It won't matter how secure the blockchain technology is if people are hesitant to use an exchange because the IRS is routinely freezing and auditing them (on claims of counter-terrorism or something) or if bitcoin mining farms are being raided/confiscated by the FBI (again, counter-terrorism, or whatever). ,The only scenario where Bitcoin takes over as the world currency is a world in which the US government/banks are , to do anything to stop it.

So let me preface this by saying Im a young person who cares deeply about the future of out planet. Climate change is real, the jury is in, and we are far behind where we should be with transforming our energy systems and consumer habits. I have no ill will for Greta and think her intentions are good, however I deeply believe that she is not helpful or productive to the cause. ,There are many in the world who share the same despair about the future and disdain for politicians who pay lip service to climate action. These are not the people we need to convince. There are many skeptics out there who doubt the science and sincerity of climate change activists and for those who we deeply need on our side, Greta is in my opinion an incredibly counterproductive force. As nice as her intentions may be, a young girl from a wealthy family who skips school and galavants the world on a private yacht meeting with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio will not convince anybody whos not already on board with climate change action. In the eyes of skeptics and deniers, Greta further reinforces the view of the other side as being entitled, elite, hypocritical and condescending. ,Change my view"

CMV: Investing in Cryptocurrency and the Use of Crypto Should Be Gradually Adopted & Be a Growing Theme in Our Society,HurriKaneKai21,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,28,"Many individuals perceive digital currency to be future of currency, thus its ever growing popularity. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that can be used to purchase goods and services, but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to protect online transactions. Individuals, financial institutions and governments should embrace the use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin as they have profound benefits in financial systems. The benefits of cryptocurrency have inspired the creation of several fintech platforms to adopt or explore the implementation of cryptocurrency in addition to fiat money for economic transactions. Cryptocurrency could represent an easier and more adaptable alternative. Investing in cryptocurrency right now could not only provide you with great returns in the near future, but could also provide you with an alternative currency of use as well.,In the 2008 financial crisis, banks and other financial institutions world wide failed, showing the fragility of the financial and monetary systems, highlighting the over reliance on the institutions. Jobs were lost, livelihoods were lost, and the economy crashed; this led to growing mistrust in fiat currencies. A possible solution to avoiding such a failure of the financial systems would be cryptocurrency. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency decreases reliance on financial institutions and fiat currencies, which would aid in avoiding such a financial crisis reoccurring. Indeed, it is evident that the trust erosion in the financial sector that was weakened by the events of the 2007/08 financial crisis, particularly in relation to banks, has encouraged the use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as an alternative form of (private) digital money. ,,Cryptocurrencies combine important properties to foster trust, such as transparency and accountability, which allows trust free interactions between countries. The underlying block chain technology uses hash functions, consensus mechanisms and public and private key encryption to control transactions, which ensure that the users dont have to trust one another. The security of cryptocurrencies should encourage individuals and institutions to invest in crypto. Blockchain technology security strengthens the security behind crypto transactions.,,A current issue that the worlds currencies all deal with is the issue of inflation. The current data shows that the projected US inflation rate will be above the accepted 2% at 3%. As more money is pumped into the economies in the form of stimulus checks for example, the value of the currency is devalued. The rising inflation rates will lead to increase of goods of prices, whilst reducing purchasing power of the average individual like yourself and myself. Currently, cryptocurrency has the potential to protect against inflation and rising prices. Seeing as there is a limited supply of crypto, cryptocurrency is more likely to be able to hold its value over some time, avoiding the effects of inflation. Lets decide to reframe our point of view and look at it from the POV of an individual using cryptocurrency for a daily transaction 5-10 years from now. The value of our crypto, may be greater than that of the dollar, thus giving us higher purchasing power. This would be a great benefit to have.,,A possible advantage could be the decentralization of crypto currencies is that there is no government or banks regulation. Thus, crypto currencies are not delimited to a specific geographic area and can be traded all over the world. Most cryptocurrencies have been created with the objective of being borderless and frictionless. Therefore, people have the chance to adopt of digital currency such as the bitcoin as they empower a common man in a way that they can conduct individual to individual transactions all around the world instantly without paying heavy charges to banks. Businesses will always continue to become more and more global moving forward, so a decentralized currency could aid the current businesses and even encourage the establishment of more businesses. This would just go ahead and help innovation and economic growth world wide. Decentralization ensures that the currency cannot be manipulated as how normal currencies sometimes are. Researchers have revealed that bitcoins can be used to provide low-cost money transfers, particularly for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally, such as remittance payments.  Beyond no doubt, the main efficiency of cryptocurrency is the elimination of intermediaries and the reduction of transaction cost. ,,Cryptocurrencies could be the future: they have good security, provide privacy and also integrity due to their cryptographic software and distributed ledger technology with irretrievable and immutable transactions records. Therefore, in the face of global uncertainty, conducting business transactions through cryptocurrency could be an effective way for people and businesses to diversify their assets. People should trade in cryptocurrency as it is safe and uses public-key cryptography for security. In fact, amidst the global coronavirus pandemic, and geopolitical power shifts, banks, people, and governments should view crypto a much feasible alternatives to fiat currency."

"CMV: YouTube is ""not profitable"" because of Hollywood accounting",TonyLund,Removed - Submission Rule E,23,35,"Why I hold this view: I am a writer-director in the science documentary space and have made numerous shows for the likes of Discovery Channel, National Geographic, History Channel, etc... some of which have even received multiple Emmy nominations. Every show I've worked on has had multi-million dollar budgets... and yet none of them have come anywhere close to attracting the size of audiences that factual channels like Vsauce, Smarter Every Day, Action Lab, Real Life Lore, Veritassium, Kurtzgesagt, etc... generate. ,In the traditional TV doc space, we would KILL for these kinds of numbers! And yet, minute-by-minute, these YouTube shows cost orders of magnitude less than what it costs to produce a competitive product on traditional TV. ,Ok, sure, let's acknowledge the critical fact that one traditional hour of television has roughly 30 ""units"" of adspace to sell (1 unit = 30 seconds of ad), whereas, 60 minutes of youtube content (broken up into multiple videos as is typical on the platform) has only 6 or so units. From what I see, the raw commercial value of 1 hour of traditional TV, at this moment in time, is thus unarguably greater than 1 hour of YouTube content even when all factors are considered (e.g. engagement, audience perceived value, audience attention, demographic focus, accuracy of viewership numbers, likelihood of conversion, etc...) ....Or is it?,Regardless, YouTube does not pay in advance for its content! It simply rewards content that it likes, punishes content that it does not like, and offers little to no explanation as to why. ,Further, YouTube charges adbuyers on average $0.1 per view and $0.3 per action. For 1,000,000 views-only from a targeted and highly curated audience, the adbuyer will thus pay YouTube about $100,000... which is about on par with what an adbuyer will pay for 30 seconds during a nationally broadcast TV show that generates a similar 1,000,000 viewers in ""the demo"". ,So, When a YouTube content creator achieves 1,000,000 viewers who watched one 30 second ad at the start of a 10+ minute video, the content creator will receive, on average, about $2,000 (,). This seems like an blatant grift, but when you run the numbers, it equates out to about 2% of ad revenue paid to the content creators for a YouTube video v.s. 3.3% of ad revenue paid to the content creators for a traditional TV show. Further, the majority of the most popular content on YouTube has only one ad, and this ad is always up front signaling to the viewer that it is something that must watch BEFORE they get to the content that makes them happy. The Adobe corporation has studied this effect and rated it as one of the most significant reasons why "","" ,So, roughly speaking, YouTube content creators are paid , to the producers of traditional TV content. ,But here's the thing... we can justify traditional TV Network sharing a mere 3% of their revenue with creators based on the fact that these networks spend exorbitant amounts promoting and marketing the content that their creators produce! YouTube doesn't. Traditional TV networks also take risk UPFRONT by paying for their content before it is produced... YouTube doesn't. ,So, let's ask ourselves the $100,000 per million viewer adbuy question: Where does the $98,000 that YouTube keeps go?,Alphabet (""Google inc"") remains tight lipped about it, much to the , Even more frustrating, the SEC tried like hell to get Alphabet to explain this, but their on going responses offered little more than, to paraphrase, ""you wouldn't understand it and we're not going to explain it to you."" The SEC , and left them with this final word: ,I also suspect that YouTube/Alphabet , be strategically hiding behind the ""web 2.0 valuation"" tradition which basically states: ""find 1 million active users first, and then figure out how to monetize them later."" If they can convince their investors that YouTube IS NOT YET a cash cow, even if it is, then all the better for YouTube/Alphabet. Which is another reason why..., If this is the case, it explains their secrecy and short-changing practices regarding content creators. ,For those not familiar, ,It's important to take a moment here to DEFEND Hollywood Accounting, lest my post be read as a conduit for me to bitch about YouTube.  (My earnest goal here is to understand going on behind the curtains at THE LARGEST MEDIA COMPANY IN THE WORLD.),The reason why Hollywood Accounting exists is not because of greed outright, but because of the EXTREME RISK associated with making movies... especially today when making a feature film for anything less than $150,000,000 is just about the stupidest thing a major movie studio could do (why this is stupid is irrelevant to topic at hand). In 1980, the monster-budget film ""Heaven's Gate"" (written and directed by then Hollywood wunderkind Michael Cimino) was so disastrous that it caused a severe economic depression for our entire industry, and then triggered every major movie studio to be sold to a Big Daddy Corporate Parent Company. Hell, when Steven Spielberg made ,, the movie studio that bankrolled it was owned by, of all things, an , ,The nature of this business has always been, and always will be, such that the HITS pay for the MISSES.

But today, the major studios only produce about 4-10 exclusive productions ('exclusive' meaning that they pay for everything themselves from start to finish). So, all it takes is ONE disastrous production to bankrupt the entire studio. ,And so the big studios have no choice but to practice Hollywood Accounting. For a variety of reasons that are irrelevant to this discussion, these studios CANNOT make movies without selling large chunks of future profits to various 3rd parties, and so they must do everything in their power to ensure that their products make a shit ton of money... while never , being 'profitable.' This is Hollywood Accounting. It's not a conspiracy, it's a ,YouTube, in my eyes, shows all the signs of following this practice.

How much is YouTube concerned about content creators demanding a larger share of the profits? What is a 'disaster scenario' for YouTube? , most likely because , has them shaking in their boots that the whole operation could be ruined in one bad move.

CMV: Anime is Just as Valid as Any Other Storytelling or Art Form,DarkWolf2017,Removed - Submission Rule E,18,27,"So, as many have seen anime is experiencing a boom, but there's just as hard of a pushback.

Take something like Berserk, it's just as adult oriented as something like say Game of Thrones, or Attack on Titan and Tokyo Ghoul which are right up there with The Walking Dead. It just seems like anime doesn't get the respect other storytelling mediums get. And in the art form part, I know I'm not the most qualified to talk about it (I studied music for a decent time, but never art) but I do have opinions. Many people are ridiculed if they draw in an anime art style, how is that any different from drawing in any other cartoon art style?

"CMV: The reason you haven't died is because of what I call the ""Quantum Solipsism"".",aisiv,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,12,"To start explaining this theory I must first explain what ""Quantum Immortality"" is.,Quantum Immortality is a variation of the SchrÃ¶dinger's cat. Supposedly, there exists an alternate universe in which you have taken the precise and right choices to live extensively until your biologic clock stops naturally and without any disease or external factor that might shorten your life even by a second, in which case, another branch will open to where that didn't happen. So you are alive and dead somewhere at the same time.,Solipsism is a belief which states everything outside yourself might be unreal, and the only certain thing in life is that ""I EXIST"". Might be that the universe is simulated, you are creating or imagining the universe, or you might be in a coma dreaming all of this somewhere else.,Quantum Solipsism seeks then, to explain why you are still alive.,This excludes, of course, everyone you coexist with: your parents, your siblings, your friends, etc. Only you as an individual exist, let's call this ""You"": ""I"" instead.,Everybody coexists right now in the same universe, Me reading this, Me ignoring this. We all are in the same page. But the thing is: ,To follow this, If I die RIGHT NOW, I will just be taken to an alternative universe in which I haven't died, that's all, maybe I will take a different choice, a different path, the disease won't trigger, the accident won't happen or maybe I won't even be there at all. Of course, I will be taken to another ""world"" where external things will remain the same because I never died, but I will never now either and nobody will.,On the other hand, If I die RIGHT NOW, everybody else will stay in this universe in which I actually died and my relatives will mourn me sadly, but the true I will be still alive in another universe that could have small differences, such as Me not remembering something everybody was sure I was involved in, mistaking an ""a"" for an ""e"" in a cereal brand I was sure it was an ""a"" but probably I died in the universe where indeed was an ""a"", a different street name, a DÃ©j Vu and so on.,There is actually no way to disprove or test this theory but thinking about why I haven't died is because of quantum solipsism is an interesting idea. ,Let's go further.,Let's say I think ""Ok, I will jump off a bridge to test this"". Two things might happen.,This could explain some visions, dÃ©j vus, single Mandela effects, or nightmares where I die, but in theory, I am indestructible, but not exempt of factors that might difficult my existence, like bad choices, but I might also die tomorrow in this universe, guess I'll never know. Eventually, my life will funnel down a lot of deaths until the biological body won't allow me to live a single extra second and then I will really die. Remember, life will only open branches from the previous universe, therefore, I will never wake up in a universe where my dog didn't die from an awful disease, unfortunately."
"CMV: If Caitlyn Jenner should be allowed to identify herself as a woman, Rachel Dolezal should be allowed to identify herself as African-American.",tfburns,Removed - Submission Rule E,256,428,"** I have CMV in example but not principle per the edit addition below but cannot change the title of this post, sorry. This change happened before anyone had commented and was not from a user of CMV, thus I have not awarded a delta for this.,If personal identity is not its naturally-occurring exterior origins, but generated by the self, and a person transforms themselves physically or mentally or in other ways to realise externally what their identity is internally, then we should treat their proclaimed identity as legitimate. Perhaps the only way we could reasonably challenge someone's identity is by knowing what they know about themselves, which - empirically and strictly speaking - is impossible. Given this, and barring obvious dishonest representations by a person, i.e. where it is clear that their motives for the transformation or holding a new identity are ulterior, we should respect the proclaimed identities of Caitlyn Jenner and Rachel Dolezal.,I do not think that this argument extends outside of personal identity, since if someone identifies themselves as a 'writer' and they are in fact a doctor who only writes prescriptions, it is reasonable for me to rejection their proclamation of a professional identity which they are obviously not, since I can externally realise this without or in spite of their internal 'knowledge' which is the basis of their proclamation, i.e. their professional identity arises from their testable actions., A similar (implied) point was made by a Facebook user on a post by the Washington Post, and another commented with ,: ""Huge difference is that Caitlin has been HONEST about said transition. This woman has a history of lies, said someone else was her father, etc. Caitlin didn't do any of those things."",I agree this is a huge difference, and perhaps a big enough difference for us to question Rachel Dolezal's motives and whether they were ulterior to her proclaimed internal personal identity.

This is presumably down to a desire to disprove claims that CNN is biased towards liberals. Imo, this is a false equivalency. Isgur has no actual experience in real journalism and has worked to provide a specific political view regardless of the facts. This is similar to claims that people who work in higher education have a liberal bias even though educated people are more likely to be liberals regardless of their profession.,Groups that complain of unfair coverage in media normally demand that some of their own get influence in media. The correct response to accusations of bias is to ignore the criticism and stay committed to uncovering the facts. If the facts consistently anger one side (whether it's republicans, anti-vaxxers, anti-semites, flat earthers or climate change denialists) the public should be informed of that. They shouldn't be able to interfere in the process to distort reality to their benefit. These groups have track records of promoting misleading information and can't be trusted with this responsibility.,Imo, there's no benefit to including groups like republicans, anti-vaxxers, anti-semites, flat earthers or climate change denialists in media coverage and journalism because their battle is with facts and evidence, not with any supposed liberal bias and this means the contribution they'd make would be negative.

Assuming that healthcare is a right, any just social arrangement would ensure that all of its members have affordable access to healthcare. But the ""public option,"" as I understand it, can achieve this: a system in which some people are covered under private insurance, but where those lacking private insurance can enroll in a state-sponsored plan, can ensure coverage for everyone. What then is the point of eliminating private insurance entirely? This seems unnecessarily disruptive and, from a pragmatic standpoint, is unlikely to achieve much support. On the other hand, if we implement a public option and people decide they prefer it to their private plans, then we could transition naturally to a single-payer system (or something close to it) simply through market incentives.,CMV."

They see it as an accusation, an attack, or a desire to seek revenge on white people for historical and ongoing injustice.,I myself find the phrase somewhat frustrating. I want everyone to have the same privileges that I do. And I'm willing to help fight for that cause. But when the notion of privilege is used as an insult, as it has become in social justice circles, many white people dis-engage.,Wouldn't it be better to re-frame the conversation around correcting non-white disadvantage? Instead of saying we need to strip white people of the privilege they possess, why not say we should be working to elevate everyone to that same level of societal privilege?,I also understand the attitude of many in the activist community: that these movements aren't about white people, so it doesn't matter how white people feel. But why antagonize? Most non-racist whites want to help fix the inequalities facing black, latino, and asian Americans.

However, the one one with the equal number of representatives from each state will have more power and terms that are three times as long.,The entire idea of equal representation by state regardless of population is ridiculous, anyway. Basically, it is saying that because you live in an area where nobody else lives, your opinions should matter more than the majority of the people in the country.,I can understand that there may be certain issues that would be better off being decided bu more rural states or areas that understand the issues better. Things that directly relate exclusively to farmers could maybe benefit from being decided by farmers rather than those who live in the cities.

If an athlete has the chance to declare to play professionally with a chance to be successful, then I believe that they should seize that opportunity.

CMV: a diagnosis of autism has become so wide-ranging and common as to be essentially meaningless.,msbunbury,Removed - Submission Rule E,2,25,"As a mum of small children and a participant in various social media parenting groups, I am flabbergasted by the frequency with which parents inform me that their child has ASD and further baffled by the number of adults who now claim to have similar. I would say, no word of a lie, that at least half the parents I know say that at least one of their children is autistic, and it's often the case that once one of them ""has it"" then the other children are soon being described in the same way. Can it really be this common? Or have we begun to medicalise a perfectly normal variant of personality? I'll be honest, I tend to think these kids often have behavioural issues rather than a medical condition, but am I just not understanding? I think my strong feeling that nobody is doing these kids any favours is probably influenced by my own knowledge that my seven year old could certainly be labelled as ASD should that be something I wanted to do."
"CMV: If you are voting for Biden just because you disagree with Trump or think that he is the only chance to get Trump out, you are part of the political problem in our country right now and are just too lazy to really look into 3rd parties.",Gingerstamp,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,14,"First off, my inbox has blown up from a recent post, so sorry if I don't respond that quickly.,,Here's some backstory:,Basically, coming up to this election, I've never been a fan of Trump. I think his policies on bringing jobs back to the U.S. is good, but that is perhaps one of the few things I see eye to eye with him on, but he is disrespectful (as we've undoubtedly seen in the first debate), and he is just bad spirited and unpresidential, overall. However, I have not been the greatest fan of Biden either. I think he is a terrible public speaker, has been a terrible racist politician also, and I don't think he stands for the best policies either (determining what hate speech is and unprotecting it under the 1st amendment, increasing stricter drug laws, interfering with foreign elections, Ukrainian-Russian militarist intervention, etc).,,My disappointment and my feeling of alienation in both parties has sent me to look into 3rd parties recently, and I found I agreed heavily with Howie Hawkins and the Green Party. I also looked into Jo Jorgensen's campaign, but I didn't fit in there too well either.,,Now that that is out of the way, I am looking to see what other's arguments are on this: ,Nearly everyone I have talked to who are going to vote for Biden are doing so because they disagree with Trump and say that they really don't agree with a lot of Biden's policies, but they believe he is the only one who can get Trump out.,,I believe this is one of the most false and, quite frankly, idiotic statements I have ever heard. If you look up the statistics for the presidential election in 2016, only around 55% of all eligible voters actually voted. That was roughly 26% of the popular vote for Trump and the other 26% for Hillary. That leaves 45% of the U.S. population of registered eligble voters who didn't vote for anyone in that election.,,If that 45% of voters who didn't vote looked into or voted for a 3rd party candidate, they would've beat both the Democrats and Republics by a landslide! And I believe it would be the same deal this year. I don't think we are going to see a big voter turnout, once again. But what drives me NUTS is the people who say a 3rd party candidate won't win and that Biden is the only one who can beat Trump, but they will never vote or even look into the 3rd party candidates anyways. Everyone who thinks that Biden is the only one who can defeat Trump is being brain fed exactly what the Democratic party wants you to think, and also think about how many other people are saying that exact same thing. If all the people who felt that Biden wasn't a great option but was the only one who could vote trump actually did LOOK INTO the 3rd parties and even VOTED for a 3rd party that maybe they would agree more with than Biden, that candidate would have the same chance to win as any other candidate everyone is handing their vote to.,,I also want to just state that I also think it is a terrible fact that the other candidates that are present on the ballots are not invited or given the chance to debate with the 2 corporate parties at these presidential debates, and it is ridiculous that they are getting kicked off ballots they already solidified for, by both the Democrats and the Republicans (check out Howie Hawkin's case in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania if you are confused about that one). I do think our whole voting process of a whole does need to change, but it does not change the fact that near half of Americans rather not vote or even vote for someone they don't fully support, rather than actually look into the 3rd party candidates and give them a chance."

Im not saying negative people shouldnt talk. No, please talk, if we dont know something bad is happening then we wont know what needs fixing. What Im saying is, given your predicament with negativity, the opinion you offer is far more destructive than constructive, and that sets us back. ,The negativity bias is real. It takes very little effort to be in a bad mood. Furthermore, negativity is often accompanied by an all-or-nothing, this world is going to shit, attitude.

Thats why I think its crucial they keep their opinions to themselves.,Now tell me you negative people, why should you not refrain from sharing your opinion?

Also, how can I not let negativity get to me so much (please no just dont, magic pill, answers). ,Tl;dr Negative people take advantage (knowingly or unknowingly) of the negativity bias.

CMV: Racial differences in IQ are not genetic,Whatifim80lol,Removed - Submission Rule E,1,62,"I've dedicated my life to the study of evolution, particularly how intelligence evolves across species over time. Naturally, the recent rehashing of ideas from The Bell Curve have really started to wear away at my patience. I have a wealth of specific, academic knowledge (both formal and self-directed) on evolution, population genetics, brain development, and intelligence. Knowing what I know, it's mind-boggling that it is so hard to dissuade people from swallowing this Race Realism fad, and at a certain point, I have to ask myself: am I the crazy one?,I gave it a lot of thought and determined why I ""know"" the race realist position is wrong, so I just flipped that into things that would persuade me if someone could provide the proper arguments. To change my view, I would need to see some of the following provided or explained:,1) What are the ""black"" genes? In order to buy that we can align socially constructed categories of race with some genetic truism, these sets of genes really need to be defined, and they should , correlate with what we'd consider ""black"" (or ""asian"" or ""white"" etc) with minimal error. And of course, to really blow my mind and seal the deal, it wouldn't just be a list of obvious superficial genes like skin color.,2) What are the ""IQ"" genes? Seriously, this is the worst offender. People have been claiming for several decades that IQ is genetic and inherited, but really there's a huge logical flaw in how this was even decided. Basically, we compiled a handful of social and developmental factors that are shown to correlate to IQ differences, and when those factors together didn't explain 100% of the variation people yelled ""AH-HAH! GENES AND RACE!"" at the remainder. That's basically a ""god in the gaps"" fallacy; the remaining factors could just as easily have been unidentified social and developmental ones, but that wasn't interesting enough I guess.,3) Imagining that these IQ genes have been identified, show me that these genes occur in significantly different frequencies across racial lines. Last I heard, the pool of potential genes for influencing IQ was over 500 possible candidates, and I couldn't determine from what I read where each of those candidates came from. I was worried that these candidates might have come from racially disproportionate samples, and so extrapolating the ""good IQ"" genes (if they're found) from this pile to other samples could warp the picture of frequency/likelihood of having high-IQ genes.,Because I've heard it before, way too many times, when asking others questions like these: No, 23 and Me tests don't prove meaningful racial differences. They look at essentially random, non-coding genes in the junk parts of the genome that only serve to show ancestry; there is nothing functional about these particular genes and obviously surprise the hell out of lots of people who , one race but share lineage with another. If anything, 23 and Me proves my point."

The exams should be a way to assert if somebody is knowledgeable enough about a subject not if he or she is smart enough to cheat and get a good grade without knowing anything about it. ,There is no need to make exams harder, there is a need to punish people who cheat a lot more, so that people actually have to study to get better grades instead of relying on cheating to having a passing grade.

"CMV: The people who claim to be ""pro-life"" but are against things like welfare, helping refugees, or increasing education funds are misusing this label",bandnerd218,Removed - Submission Rule E,99,81,"(Note: be sure to look at the edits.) Pro-life sounds, at face value, like it would be a label that most people would be for, however it is used only for discussion on abortion. People can be anti-abortion and call themselves pro-life even when they are against many measures used to help people after birth. ,While one cannot go policing labels, I think that it is rather silly to call oneself ""pro-life"" based on merely your stance on abortion. Especially when (in the US) the majority party that is anti-abortion is also anti-wealfare, anti-immigrant/refugee, largely prejudiced against a number of minorities, and anti-comprehensive sex ed (it seems to me that having sex ed that involves conversation on contraceptives rather than only abstinence would reduce abortions). ,I would argue that people who are for measures that help people in general and for measures that would reduce abortion rather than outlawing it are actually more pro-life than most people who claim to be pro-life. CMV!,Edit: I'm going to be a bit more specific. I am not referring to all conservatives/republicans in this. A few of you have pointed out that many people want , of welfare, immigration, and what have you - but this isn't about people who want comprehensive reform. It's people who want to cut funding with no further consideration or cut the programs altogether. ,Additionally, I am not arguing about the morality of abortion. I am arguing that only being anti-abortion does not make you pro-life if you are against programs to help retain life or quality of life, or are for programs that kill. Because of this, using pro-life rhetoric when you are not comprehensively for betterment and longevity of lives is hypocritical, divisive, and unhelpful to general conversation around abortion and even unhelpful for the pro-life movement. ,I am looking for: 1) someone to convince me that the label means something to those that hold anti-abortion views but are alright with sacrificing some life or quality of life for other things (because now, to me the label seems empty - mere emotional rhetoric to guilt people into staying silent). 
2) reasoning behind using the term or benefits (for actual rich discussion and/or for the pro-life movement) of using it when one is not comprehensively for life that isn't rooted in ""well, this is their party and they're far right so that's what they think"" - especially when said person is openly of a Darwinist opinion that many anti-welfare folx seem to be of. ,Honestly, I feel sort of bad that my tips brain felt that this was the best subreddit for this because I mostly want to see conversation around this topic and topic tangential to it. But, I would like to be less hostile towards the labels that people use in general and regards to this argument, so I suppose it's good.  ,Edit 2: After sleep and another look, my initial question is not the best way to put together my thoughts on the issue. The people that would hinder the pro-life side are few and far between who , that certain lives don't matter (not that they don't have biases that make more issues with that... But that isn't relevant I don't suppose). So, these people are more straw men than actual people. So if they aren't prominent in the conversation, people would not address them, perhaps. (But I would argue that those people are becoming more vocal and the movement may have problems if they start in on the abortion debate more heavily. At that point there may be more issues),While I would still like input on that portion of my post, I think the main focus that I'm still not sold on is how are these labels (pro-choice too - it's a problematic label though ""pro-life"" has extra weight with the ""x lives matter"" movements and soforth) are good for the movement. I think that they rely on guilting the other side into silence and don't do anything to help bring about conversation of or solutions. ,Is there any context that would make these terms make more sense in terms of argument? How are these labels actually helpful? If they aren't helpful then why aren't people lobbying for other labels (other than even more divisive ones like ""anti-choice"" or ""anti-life"")"
CMV: Attempting to contact aliens is low risk,Atheist1414,Removed - Submission Rule E,50,64,"Stephen Hawking and several others have discouraged trying to contact aliens citing what has historically happened in the past when a more intelligent civilization encounters a less advanced civilization, but this seems paranoid to me. Is it really reasonable to expect aliens to come to earth and enslave, eat, or kill humans and steal our oil and water? If they have mastered interstellar travel, they don't require oil or water. They can probably fuse atoms together or ""print"" whatever molecules they need. An alien specie capable of interstellar or intergalactic travel also would have found an endless supply of any resource in the universe given how many planets there are and how common water exoplanets seem to be. Mars had water at one point. There's strong evidence of water on Europa. If it happened 3+ times in this solar system, its everywhere. An advanced race of aliens would have better sources of energy than chemical (eating us). Solar seems to be an abundant source and there are plenty of stars that haven't been drained out there. Their primary energy source is most likely to be something we don't have a great understanding of like dark energy or antimatter or something even more potent. There is nothing on earth that they need. And how productive or useful would humans be as slaves? ""I can do basic addition and I'm good at video games...what is thy bidding?"" They are sure to have advanced AI and robots (or even created artificial biological life) capable of infinitely more than us. As far as killing us altogether, if they made it this far as a specie they likely have more peaceful and diplomatic tendencies to have survived past their own nuclear, technological, quantum and other discoveries we can't even fathom. They must have some respect for life to have not wiped themselves out, which Hawking and others have said we're likely to do within the next few thousand years. There ""critical points"" that an intelligent specie encounters as they gradually evolve (nuclear weapons). If they fail to pass any critical point, they go extinct. If humans survive another 100k years, it's likely we're going to have passed every critical point and we're around for good. If an alien specie has existed for 100 million years without wiping themselves out, they are not as violent or aggressive as movies make them out to be. ,This all ignores the absurdity of superimposing human tendencies on aliens. We have no idea what aliens with 100 million or more years of existing could be like, but we're going to assume they'd do what we'd probably do in the same situation. Doesn't make sense. Additionally, if aliens were really that advanced, they are likely to have already detected our existence. Humans have been been sending out radio waves into the universe for over 100 years. There IS a difference between radio waves that escape to space and intentionally broadcasting signals directly at exoplanets we think could harbor intelligent life, but if aliens are super advanced, it would seem they would have equipment sensitive enough to detect both regardless.,To me, it is more likely if there are super advanced aliens, they already know we are here and have decided we're bad news (don't blame them) and better left alone, or have some non-intervention principle.,Lastly, in my opinion the most likely scenario is there are no highly intelligent aliens within 1000 or even 10,000 light years of us (Fermi Paradox). So it's pointless to send out signals or try to contact extraterrestrial intelligence. But to not do it with the reason being fear of our own safety and well being is paranoid and I don't understand the argument. I think the risks are minimal. (There could be potential benefits that may or may not outweigh the potential costs, but im only assessing the potential costs here)."

CMV: Reducing carbon emissions to address climate change is a waste of resources,WillPukeForFood,Removed - Submission Rule E,8,27,"For the last 10 years or so I've been reading with increasing frequency statements from climatologists that amount to an admission that time's up for halting catastrophic climate change (CCC) through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  As just one example, see , IPCC chart from last October (full report ,).  Of course, there are plenty of people who believe we still have x years to halt it, and I'm not here to have a debate over who's right.  ,My question is, if you're in the first camp, what's the point of spending even a dollar to reduce emissions instead of spending that dollar on adaptation?  I realize that reducing emissions may reduce the severity, and/or delay the start, of CCC, but it seems to me the relationship between the amount and rate of reduction and those benefits is highly speculative; we're still going to get hammered, regardless.  ,On the other hand, there are things we know we can start doing today to help civilization survive and thrive in a warmer world (build sea walls around coastal cities, develop temperature resistant crops, research cures for tropical diseases, etc.).  Even if you're convinced we should still be spending something on reduction, isn't the resource allocation lopsided?  I don't follow the climate change discussion very closely, but it seems like 99.9% of the money (and conversation) is about reduction and not about adaptation."
"CMV: Marriage is a decision that has to be made logically, not with emotion",ShakeNBakeMormon,Removed - Submission Rule E,10,27,"Marriage is one of the oldest institutions in human history. And yet, many people believe that love should be the be-all-end-all deciding factor in marriage. This idea is appalling and idiotic in my view, for a myriad of reasons. ,,First of all, what is the point of marriage? Simple: it's a symbiotic relationship between two individuals, for the benefit of themselves, their families, and their communities. It benefits oneself by granting a companion who covers your weaknesses and provides for one things they can't or have difficulty providing oneself. It benefits the family by creating a catalyst for such, allowing for the birthing of children in an environment of multiple role models who provide and care for them. It benefits the community because the two parents will work together to discipline their children so that they can interact with the world around them. That is, after all, what one's identity is: the product of their negotiation with society. As such, the parents come together to create children who benefit their family and community, and eventually get married and become parents themselves. ,,As such, when one is deciding who to marry, one must take all of these factors into account. One must remember that marriage is a vow, with hopefully only two reasons for ending it, those being infidelity and abuse. Divorce is horrendous for the psyche of the individuals divorcing, as well as any children they have. (In fact, the death of a parent has been shown to negatively impact children's academic achievement and general well-being to a LESSER degree than their parents divorcing.) As such, one cannot base the decision on emotions such as love and happiness, as these inevitably fade away over time. If your marriage is built on no stronger foundation, then it will be too weak to easily continue. ,,Love in marriage is a blessing, but were it a requirement, every marriage ever would end in divorce. More people should realize the point of the institution as to create fewer unsuccessful marriages, and more marriages that benefit society.

But this isn't about Mike Pence specifically, it's about a way to prevent crooked candidates from picking terrible VPs that will make their impeachment less likely because everyone is scared of the backup President. I think the US should move to electing the VP individually, instead of the two positions being linked together.,Because you can't have a P and VP from different parties due to the possibility of assassination, that would mean everyone would have to vote for both a Democrat and a Republican (and third parties too, although I think it's likely most people would skip that part), and the VP winner who belonged to the party of the winning P would be the one to take office.,PROS:,CONS:,I know that none of this will actually happen since it would require MAJOR rewriting of the Constitution.

"CMV: Regarding internet privacy, I have nothing to fear if I have nothing to hide.",Nonexistence,Removed - Submission Rule E,9,69,"Help me, dear fellow redditors, because I have been told time and time again that this is a stupid view to hold in these woeful days of big brother surveillance, but I have still yet to receive substantive responses to my reasons for holding such a view to make me understand my stupidity. I truly want to be wrong on this, but first I want to know why.,To preface, when I say ""I have nothing to fear if I have nothing to hide,"" I am talking about myself specifically and the group of people similarly situated to me who 1. do not participate in crimes or lead embarrassing double lives that would be revealed through government surveillance of their online activity and 2. are not bothered in some vague and inarticulable ""this is creepy"" sense by the mere fact of government employees looking through their personal data, pictures, and communications. I fully recognize that people fall into those categories and I think it is reasonable that they are not comfortable with government surveillance of their online activity.,Given that, my stance is that I simply don't see what the detriment of government surveillance of me and people similarly situated to me is.,To flesh this out more, I'm going to go ahead and give my responses addressing the most common attacks on my stance. Generally, I think these attacks are common because they are easily mimetically reproduced but are frequently based on misinformation, false equivalencies, or otherwise don't take their own underlying logic seriously. If you're responding to a specific one of these, feel free to mention it by number in your response:,1) ""That's like saying you oppose freedom of speech because you have nothing to say"",This is a false equivalency because the capacity to freely express yourself is frequently a good thing, whereas the capacity for illegal activity is almost never a good thing. As such, I don't think 1) really says much of anything and is frequently used to dismiss or shout down people of my view without critically engaging with them or substantively repudiating their points.,2) ""Well then why don't you post your passwords to your email and bank accounts so we can have a look around?"",My reading of this kind of response is that it is an attempt to make people realize all the things they really wouldn't want other people seeing, but I think it fails because it's a false equivalency. It's a false equivalency because if someone did post those things, they would risk doxxing, a viewer impersonating them with their social media profiles, or a viewer stealing their money with no legal recourse against that person, which is why the person doesn't actually post the information rather than fear of others just seeing their communications and financial details. I think a more accurate challenge would be something along the lines of ""why don't you post a screenshot of your most recent bank statement with the account number redacted"" which I don't think people in my position would be at all reticent to do.,3) ""How would you like it if insurance agencies used your data to increase your rates?"",In essence, this response argues that it is good that insurance companies currently are imperfect at valuing the cost of insuring people because they might be undervaluing you. Sure, if I'm A) acting purely on self-interest and B) think that insurance companies are undervaluing the cost of insuring me, I benefit from their current lack of information. However, they might also be overvaluing me due to that lack of that information. I'm a relatively healthy person - I work out every other day, eat well, and don't have any diseases or conditions that make me likely to be undervalued by insurers. If that is the case, aren't I being ripped off by subsidizing all the other people paying in who are undervalued? Wouldn't it be a good thing for me if they started paying what they actually cost to insure? Shouldn't I be rewarded for being healthy? Sure, many people are unhealthy for reasons outside of their control, and my subsidizing their undervalued rate would arguably be more just to them, but insurance is a risk-spreading mechanism, not a charity. In my view, 3) is implicitly arguing that the insurance market is somehow better because it values individuals imperfectly, and that is something worth preserving, but that just seems A) obviously not true when viewed objectively in the same way it's obviously preferable to have an accurate stock market than an inaccurate one, and B) bad from the individual perspective of everyone that the current insurance market overvalues, because they are subsidizing everyone it undervalues.,4) ""There's no oversight! It violates due process!"",This is factually untrue. Every federal intelligence agency has internal controls, executive orders, administrative regulations, internal and external oversight committees, and federal law it must comply with. But let's assume for a second that we're very skeptical of the effectiveness of government bureaucracy. ,Even then, all government actors are subject to the 4th amendment. Put in the simplest way possible, online or in the streets, if the government wants to use evidence against you in court, they have to show they complied with the same warrant requirements as everyone else (which entails a judge determining they didn't look anywhere someone would objectively expect to have privacy until they had probable cause that illegal activity was there). So hypothetically, say you're prosecuted for a crime and the only evidence against you was found through online investigation. Your lawyer says ""Was this obtained pursuant to a lawfully executed warrant?"" If no, it can't be used against you. If yes, you had the same rights as if you did the crime on the streets. No intervention necessary from cold and distant federal bureaucracies to protect you.,5) ""Hackers can obtain your information."",Indeed they could, just like they could from the places the government collected the data from. There's some level of inherent risk to just about everything you do in life, but you do them anyway because the alternative would be paralyzing. In my view, what really matters here is how well secured are we when data breaches occur when they inevitably do? As an obvious example, the response to the Equifax breach is actually really powerful evidence that we are well protected when breaches occur. Not only is there immense awareness raising media coverage, assistance from Equifax with credit freezes, and a huge class action suit for allowing the breach to occur which works to hold people accountable and incentivize optimal security, but anyone who can show actual damages from having their identity stolen can sue Equifax to recover those. If the consequence of a data breach were that individuals had no recourse, I think my position would be changed completely, but the fact that individuals have just as much recourse as if a pre-internet business negligently lost the paper records of their personal information makes me feel like the risk is no greater than what we've all accepted and tolerated as long as bank accounts have existed.,6) ""What if the government collects data on you and then later decides the activity you're doing is bad?"",I honestly don't know what this is trying to say. If laws are passed to make something illegal, they won't make ex post facto occurrences of that thing illegal. Whenever I'm met with this response I ask people for a concrete example of what they're talking about and I've literally never gotten one.,As an aside, and because it always comes up, I think that when and if the viewing of data of online habits becomes a normal and accessible thing for everyone in society, a lot of culture shock around it will dissipate. It won't be any weirder to look at people's browsing history than it is to look at their blogs and facebook pages now. Some things people may find embarrassing now I expect will seem less so when it's obvious public knowledge that most other people are looking at similar things as well. If you have reasons to believe that culture shock around those things won't be pearl clutching and relatively short-lived, please let them be known.,CMV!,Edit to link to some comment responses that might also address common responses to this stance and otherwise avoid duplicative replies:"

The income gap will increase, with the men owning the companies employing robots owning a very large majority of all the money in the US.,My opinion is not that there are no solutions, but that our current democratic system and the gridlock in Congress will mean that solutions will never see the light of day because politicians are looking for votes and not the betterment of the country.

CMV: The Dave Chappelle backlash is absurd and the reason he left in 2005,chiwork,Removed - Submission Rule E,36,44,"There has been a lot of criticism on the blogosphere and all the typical avenues where dust kicks up one way or the other. I've searched Reddit and unfortunately the only real hits it has is t_d so theres no point to follow the convo there. I also don't think its ""PC"" backlash because I find that as a pointless phrase to hurl and it seems the criticism isnt actually PC police its more that people think he should have made the jokes better. If anything the criticism to me seems more like a [white] privilege symptom. I really don't want to turn this into a liberal debate, so I am specifically referring to the critics of this special, I'm not going dumb it down and paint them all the same way because I don't believe that. I also don't think the critics only those ""triggered"" SJW rich white liberal stereotype people use whenever talking about people who mention PC.,Although I'm sure a fair amount of of the bloggers ,  (and I guess I was too), the vast majority of the criticism is from people who are looking to use his art as a statement. ,I will admit his jokes on gay and trans people weren't his funniest, but they werent very far out of line with comedy and find it hard to hear people base the entire show off of those or even say that ruined it for them or they wont watch the rest. ,In killing them softly and a lot of Chappelle show skits he touched on personal topics of the late 90s and early 2000s, but he touched them in the same manner. Though part of it was him in performance mode, the audience loved laughing when he said nigga every 5 words, his black characters were almost all from the ghetto, uneducated, afraid of police, got high often, loved fried chicken, etc. His famous 3 a.m. in the ghetto bit is stuff of legends, the joke is so ridiculous and paints so many stereotypes it is overlooked. These audiences ate up all his jokes while playing up the black stereotypes despite the fact both of his parents are college professors. I have absolutely no issue with that, but his style has always been to use stereotypes of groups to make some outlandish claim. Again, think about most of the characters in his standup bits and some from the Chappelle Show. The only racist people in these stories are typically southerners and typically older white men, ,These audiences have no problem laughing at some outlandish characiture of black folks and laughing at white people when they are the cartoonish embodiment of bigoted white people who are southern and/or the old white conservatives. And he can say practically anything with these two groups and no one says a word. I get the power of comedy and the whole ""punching up"" theory some people are trying to use, but the whole point is this has been. You can't only deliver tailoired zingers like a Daily Show segment over the course of standup. His style has always been to comment on how different groups interact in society, it's always been group a and group b then punchline. Or detail on group a then punch line. ,That being said, I'm not going to be obtuse and act like that Dave hasnt welcomed his ability to make social commentary. HIs references and social commentary are what garnered him getting a $60mil deal and he's so popular because of his material on topical issues. I'm not sure if its too fresh of a topic, but the gay and trans jokes to me are exactly what comedy are. He brings up a topic we know, he gets it in your head, then he pulls the rug out on the punchline(outrageous, as is his style), then you laugh because that thought was somewhere in your head or the view was presented in a funny method. ,In , review of the special, the author mentions that he admired the old jokes about Pepe Le Pew and appluaded his ability to be witty, conscious and hilarious at the same time. I agree with that. To me, though, all these writers sufferening from priviegeitis feel as though his jokes on trans people are unfunny and mean spiritied and fail to see the similarities. For example the pro \noun joke that boils down to 'how much do I have to participate in your exploration' as the punchline. To me this joke is funny because he is commenting on an inner dialogue as he explains the first time he learned about this practice within the trans community. The ""pronoun"" battle isn't some widely known and practiced routine for a fair amount of people. Even if it is, his joke is harkening back and make you reimagine the first time you learned something. His joke boils down to, ""I learned this thing that happens in the world, while that thing is not natural, I accept it and thats the way the world works. However, when you think about it, there is a funny inner dialogue when analyzing it for the first time"" to me thats similar to the Pepe Le Pew joke. Just because the punchline is trans peoples preference of pronoun usage and not rape culture in a childrens cartoon doesnt mean his style is any different or mean. , ,As I just explained, his joke structure is pretty consistent to how they always have been. If you think of the vest vast majority of his best standup bits and Chappelle Show skits, his style is to use the world and different people in an outlandish way to deliver his joke. Dave never saw a baby at 3am, he never asked a cop for directions with a high white friend, he doesnt think Bill Clinton would kiss a little ""nigger baby"". He is just using real life to make a comment on different people and groups. HIs style isnt to tell some ridiculous story that happened to him and thats it, the story typically ties in race (black and white) or money (rich white people) or some other distinct group. I've seen a lot saying the Bill Cosby jokes and trans guys ""tricking guys"" joke as two examples of what people did not like. While I wouldnt say these two would touch the middle to end of Killing Them Softly, they were still quite witty and topical. Again I'll circle back to my ""privilegeitis"" term I made up. Dave actually somewhat brings up this topic during his second special. He has two telling comments. The first is when he comments on a feminists and says ""You were in on the heist, you just want to much of the pot"" and then mentions how he is an ally of gay people but just hates bloggers. His points here are, going thru 40+ years as a black man in this country (albeit pretty wealthy and famous for almost half of that), he wouldn't be making these jokes to be mean or disrepsectful, he's just making jokes on another group. Like my previous points he's saying 'you all were happy to laugh to my obviously exaggerated takes on black people (like uneducated, paranoid, deathly affraid of the police) and the outrageous natural connection that all older, wealthy, conservative white people are racists from his stories. And he makes these jokes because you are supposed to believe that these are real stories, real thoughts, and a look into the world from his eyes. In killing them softly he became a legend making a joke about a crack dealing baby out at 3am. Im sure no one actually believed it, but joking on some pretty vile stereotypes and the real world tragedes was a okay then. ,Like he says in the first part ""If police were killing gays and transgenders like they have been black people [there would be a lot bigger issues.]"" I say this acknowledging a couple bigger black publications have lodged criticism as well, but it seems to circulate from the same [white] priviledge bubble where the light gets turned on and off on whether sometihng is a joke and which words can be said when. , ,As is pretty well known now, he left when he thought a white audience member was laughing at his characters and not with them. While this is quite literally the opposite of that, it is still along the same lines of his audience being unable to seperate jokes from real life. I dont understand why the Ignition Remix skit is both a biting, scathing, witty and legendary skit, but then his allegorical reference comparing Bill Cosby to the Superhero is one where we are uneasy. As I said before, his style is one where we are supposed to enter the world through his eyes as 40+ year old black comedia dave chappelle. Perhaps, in his eyes and as he states, he can fully condemn and be mortified in what Bill Cosby did, but still be able to make a joke about how he did some good along with all the bad. The joke isnt even as effective in a vaccuum, but in a reference to an earlier joke I think its actually one of his better comedic takes. It's not a very vocal segment of people, but there is a pocket of some individuals who havent rushed to dump on Bill Cosby (taken this is stuff written in late 2015 and performed early 2016). It's not unheard of at that time for a middle aged black man to have no rushed to declare Bill Cosby eequivalent to the leader of Isis at that time in the story and could perhaps at least acknowledge there is a footnote to Cosby and not a 1 dimensional villan. I'm not saying I agree, or find this to be a joke that could spark a dissertation, but I'm annoy at the levels of privilege to only accept certain takes from Dave and not take them all. This wasnt said during a Barbara Walters interview, this was said during his standup, it may not resonate with everyone but people thinking this is a joke which requires you to agree with his take ruins comedy.  ,I'm not going to use hyperbole and say 'would you rather have an unfunny but woke amy schumer or a funny but offensive Chappelle, because those arent the only options. To me though, the groupthink coming from the hivemind of privileged bloggos and twitterrati individuals is a ridiculous reaction"

Neighborhoods have low property value, people see an opportunity to invest, it attracts higher class people, and the area gets better. Seems logical to me. There arent any laws that are making this happen. It just makes sense. ,The only reason this is an issue is because people in these neighborhoods dont want people of different cultures or ethnicities in the neighborhood that was for the most part homogeneous before. They used to be able to look around and see everyone was like them, and now outsiders are coming in and they dont like it.

A mortgage is on average $100k down payment and $3k/month. While renting is $1.7k/month. Wouldnt that money be better used on creating experiences and memories in like a year of traveling vs. investing in a material item that when were on our deathbed, wouldnt bring us joy? Sure, mortgages can be a good economic decision but does it really make us happy? ,Im currently 24 and at a point in my life where everything is going great. Ive been told many times by older people that theyre impressed by how much I got my shit together for my age. Basically working my dream job, getting paid well, got adulting on lock. ,So now I want to invest more in my future and start being financially smart. I know the younger you start, the better off you are. So I made this plan for myself: ,1) Pay off student and car loans in 1.5 years (I have about $50k in total debt) 
2) With extra money (after debts are paid), I will invest in stocks/bonds and heavily save up for a mortgage 
3) Get a mortgage by age 30 ,Sounds like a decent plan until I started poking holes....,A) I currently live in San Diego and love this city! I can see myself settling down here but the average mortgage is like $800k for a 3 bedroom house....yeah its really expensive and you basically need two people to afford a house here unless youre super rich. ,This got me thinking why I even want a mortgage? Am I just playing a narrative that society imposes? Go to college, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc. The more I think about that narrative, the more it makes me sad. Youre constantly in debt or chasing financial freedom. ,Maybe Im just a millennial or I have this weird anti-obsession with material things but I dont see the appeal of actually owning a house. Sure, I can call it mine but we all end up dying anyways (sorry if thats too morbid, Im just being realistic). It in turns becomes someone elses property or you end up selling the house anyways and going to a retirement home. For me, a house provides a roof over my head and I can get that with renting plus renting is cheaper overall in San Diego. ,B) I realized that I dont like being in debt. Having to pay off my car/student loans is already a sucky feeling. To think that once I pay it off, Ill be in more debt and for a longer period?? I can do so much with the money that might be used on a mortgage or heck, a down payment for a mortgage! I could travel the world. Live in other countries, explore every corner of this planet. I want to travel while Im young and dont have kids and too much responsibility. Sure I can do it when Im retired but my body wont be in the best shape. ,A stable job and mortgage will always be here waiting for me to come back, but the opportunity to travel is far and few between. ,I guess Im just tired of the pressure to buy a house or being told that rent is just money being thrown away. You can always make more money but you cant make more time. ,Does anyone else feel this way? Or have been through this feeling? Anyone currently living that narrative and wished they didnt get a mortgage? Is anyone truly happy now that theyre stuck in a mortgage? Is this just a sign that Im not ready to settle down yet but I should still save money for that? Or is this just a phase and I will eventually want to settle down? ,I know some of you may respond why worry about this now?. Because I want to set myself up for success and not be blindsided by not having saved enough money for the right thing.

I also assume the current stats on child custody favoring the female, meaning the man may have minor custody and the woman major custody,Now let's suppose the man sexually cheats on the woman, and ends up impregnating another woman. The cost to the guy is obviously significant, namely legally (and morally) he must spend money and/or time with his child. The cost to the woman in the relationship is near zero, assuming the man can spend a similar amount of time with the woman in the relationship as he did before. Even if this is reduced, it could just equate to the time he may have spent taking up a new hobby. Ultimately, the woman's life and goals are hardly affected.,Now let's explore an alternative scenario: the woman in the relationship being impregnated by another man.

VoX released a good article on how malleable the definition of terrorism is and why it depends on who you ask and what their political views are.  ,Please change my view that there is no real workable definition of terrorism because every purported definition of terrorism is either: ,(1) outright prejudiced (e.g., not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims);
(2) too broad to have any real use as a category crimes (e.g., all violent crimes directed to incite terror in the population); and
(3) too narrow in that it excludes certain events that most people reflexively label as terrorism. ,Change my view that based on the lack of a workable definition, the label is too vague and ambiguous to be a useful descriptor as a category of crimes."

CMV: Country music is BORING,sjdjgdhskgdf,Removed - Submission Rule E,3,35,"The best way I can think of conveying my opinion is comparing it to a few other genres, which I deem as not boring:,
1) Rap - rap quite often has incredible rhyme schemes, and I have , heard a country song that has any rhyming in it other than one or two words per line. In addition, rap is based around rhythm, and country music's rhythm is slow and rarely varies from this. Rap can be slow or very fast, and varies with every song, keeping it ,.,
2) Metal/Rock: Rhythm is another factor here, but the main difference is the complexity of the music itself. With so many different varying melodies, harmonies, and chords, rock/metal is always interesting. I've never heard a country song that exists beyond a basic scheme of chords, it is dull and boring.  ,In conclusion, I believe country music is boring because it is usually monotonous, with no rhyme scheme, dull/slow rhythm, and has little to no complexity in the music itself (basic chords and melodies). I cannot see any part of country that stands out and doesn't make it boring and tedious to listen to. "

To sum it up, no motivation, procrastinate on 5 minute tasks, can't find enjoyment in anything.,Now, I have tried anti depressants before.  I was on four different ones previously, Lexapro made me lethargic and have suicidal thoughts, Welbutrin made me fucking insane and on brink of suicide, something else I only took for a few days that gave me extreme migraines, and Zoloft I just experienced every side effect and really didn't do anything for me.

"CMV: The judge and plaintiff in the Bill Cosby case were not after justice, they were after publicity/revenge/money by sending him to prison instead of house arrest.",fsutrill,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,21,"Listening to the sentencing, the judge commented that he would not treat Cosby any differently than any other prisoner. Everyone assumed this to mean this in the sense of giving him special treatment (such as house arrest instead of jail time) due to his status. The woman just came forward now- the only one of his accusers still within the statute of limitations and taking it upon herself to be the sole spokesperson for all of the accusers and be a hero. She acts as though she's been traumatized for life- if that were the case, why didn't we hear that she went to therapy or something after the alleged incident to help her get over it if it was that bad? It was 14 years ago, in Cosby's own home. ,So, Cosby, age 81, is sentenced to prison. His lawyer asked that the sentence be carried out as a house arrest due to Cosby's age/physical condition. ,When the judge sentenced Cosby and made his speech about 'not going to treat you any differently', he then sends him to prison. But he did treat him differently. In a Machiavellian way, he put Cosby in prison to serve as an example/warning to other people with the same status and clout. I also believe that the judge was trying to make a name for himself as 'the man who put Cosby in prison' and become the next Judge Eto (OJ Simpson's case). Here is another quote:  , , He was then sentenced to 3-10 years for 3 counts of aggravated sexual assault (not rape) and the designation of 'sex offender'.  ,The 'victim' was overjoyed. To me (a woman who was sexually assaulted at age 12), that doesn't seem like justice, it seems like revenge. ,Especially since the appeal filed by the defense attorney cites 11 different things the judge mishandled during the trial - including evidence and other witness testimony. The judge called Cosby a "", I can't see how house arrest wouldn't be justified - why prison for an over-80 almost blind man? How could he re-offend?

CMV: It is highly immoral to accumulate and spend more wealth than you can consume instead of spending it on the disadvantaged,powerofinformation,Removed - Submission Rule E,1,41,"I am not only looking to change my view rather get to the moral truth. English is not my native language so I will try my best to explain the view but do ask me if you do not understand anything. ,Anyways, I believe that accumulating wealth far more than what you can consume is immoral. For the sake of discussion lets consider that amount 50 million USD. That means if you have a net worth of 50 million USD you already have all of what a person can consume. You can have a plane, spend on whatever you like etc. Any amount above that will not provide you significant additional marginal utility of consumption. Sure, with a 1 billion you could travel to space or fund a space exploration and that would make you happy but spending so much for your fleeting small happiness when there are millions of starving people out there is just immoral. ,Therefore, anyone who has wealth more than what they can consume should give away the rest. It is immoral if they keep on accumulating/earning more instead of giving it away. In fact, the poor have a right to this ridiculous excess money. It is inhumane, disgusting and pure evil to accumulate more than this amount. Furthermore, if one spends this excess money on ""useless charities"" like art foundations instead of for the benefit of the poor than that's evil as well. It is also evil to give money for the benefit of people who already have their basic needs met while those that do not have their basic needs are suffering. Therefore, it would be immoral to pay for cars or similar luxuries of say Americans (they can always use a motorbike) instead of using that money to pay for the people dying in developing countries. ,Now, I am not saying hand out the poor free money. That makes people dependant. Rather help out the poor around the world by providing infrastructure to get them good jobs, like infrastructure, education and help those who are in real need like food aid, healthcare etc. ,I guess my view is a bit colored due to the fact that I am from South Asia where the culture is such that excess accumulation of money and spending on oneself and not helping others is considered very evil. What benefits society is considered the most important. Reporters frequently write about profiteering of the mentality, communism etc. The virtues of simple living are prized highly as well. "
CMV: Parading with other nation flags on the national day is unnecessary and insulting,dogepoli,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,12,"I am part of a pretty liberal group of friends, and some argue that it would be undemocratic to disallow display of foreign nation-flags on this day. While I do not vouch for a ban (which would be authoritarian), I think that it is rude and unnecessary of anyone to show up to a May 17th (Norways national day)-parade with a foreign flag.,The national day of a country usually celebrates independence from a previous union, or sovereignity. In Norway, we celebrate our constitution which declares the country an independent kingdom. Parading with a danish or swedish flag, is disrespectful with regards to history and should not be done. Either way, a few people do so each year, as a way to demonstrate their ancestry.,While I can understand the wish to show where you come from, there are many other opportunities to do so. For example, citizens of foreign ancestry could organize parades going through town on their respective countries' national days.,Another argument that my friends came up with, was that it could be a way to demonstrate free speech. I can, to some extent, see the value in this, but I do not believe that rudely intercepting an important historical day (for many) is the best way to demonstrate free speech. I am not really very keen on nationalism, but I respect the one day every year that we celebrate our country on. I think that this should be an even stronger point for immigrants (from anywhere); I see respect for the history and culture of your country as key to integration.,While none of my friends could provide viewpoints that successfully changed my mind, I am open to hear more counterpoints.

CMV: Terrorism is much less of an issue than we are led to believe and money should be spent elsewhere.,zarmesan,Removed - Submission Rule E,13,20,"My point here is to say that people, mainly the US government and many of its citizens, make a disproportionately big deal out of terrorism.,To start off, it needs to be noted that the death toll to terrorist attacks is much smaller than propaganda makes it seem. It is blown up by the news. If you look at the Global Terrorism Database (,) you can calculate how many deaths have happened to terrorists attacks in the past couple decades or so.,This article (,) explains it quite well. However, it is a bit outdated (5 years). The gist is that the chances of dying to a terrorist attack are 1 in 20 million, while the chances of dying to heart disease are 1 in 7 and the chances of dying to cancer are 1 in 7. Even factoring in the recent deaths, which are admittedly more than in previous years, the chances of dying to a terrorist attack are extremely slim. Using the outdated information from the article finds that you have, or had, a higher chance of dying to a falling coconut.,If you continue to look at the database, you'll find that the majority of incidents are domestic. The majority of terrorists are not your bomb carrying Muslims. Many of the attacks do not end up with fatalities. One of the groups with the most attacks is the Animal Liberation Front and they haven't killed any people.,The reason this all concerns me is that 80% of voters thought terrorism was an important issue when making their decision on the election. The money being spent on surveillance, which hasn't stopped a planned full on terrorist attack once, could be used on researching more on cancer or even towards an effort in trying to prevent car crashes.,And to add even more, there is far less Terrorism in the US compared to anywhere else in the world, especially in places like southern Asia.,Now change my view!"

Not to say that Rachel takes , fault, because they definitely both made mistakes that night. But ultimately, Ross was in the wrong and Rachel was right to break up with him. ,1) They never defined what ""taking a break"" meant. Yes, they , on a break. But clearly Rachel thinks this means something different from a ""break up"" because during their fight Ross says ""I thought we were broken up"" and Rachel says ""we were on a break!"" clearly implying that being on a break isn't the same thing as being broken up.,2) A break would imply spending some time apart for self reflection and personal space. The ultimate goal would be reconciliation, and during this time I would think it fair to assume that both parties should remain faithful to one another. Much like taking a vacation from work (let's assume you have a non-compete agreement); you aren't actively working for the company that week but you also can't do contracting work for the competitor down the road, either.,3) If reconciliation is the goal, remaining faithful is an obvious way to show your partner you're committed to working things out between you. Ross recognizes that what he did was wrong, as he spends so much effort making sure that Rachel didn't find out what happened.,4) There was no final ""we're broken up"" one way or the other. Ross walks out of the room during their initial argument, and later when they are in the process of making up over the phone, he hangs up on her without giving her a chance to explain. It was presumptuous for him to assume to they were broken up, and therefor no longer committed to each other. In fact, it is my firm belief that he didn't think they were broken up. Rather, he assumed the worst when he heard Mark's voice, assumed Rachel was going to sleep with him, and proceeded to sleep with the copy girl as revenge. ,5) Ultimately, Ross is in the wrong because he only decides he was in the right , Rachel ended the relationship for good. At first he is ridden with guilt, feels awful for what did, and is clearly remorseful. When Rachel doesn't forgive him, his pride kicks in. He's angry and bitter at , for screwing up his relationship with Rachel, and projects that anger towards Rachel in an attempt to make himself not seem like the bad guy. He's simply incapable of accepting fault, and this is the equivalent of a grown man's temper tantrum when his parents won't buy him a new ice cream because he threw the first one on the floor in anger."

But, now, an action done contradicting such an agreement, thus betraying its promise, is wrong; (7.) and also, an action done in accord with such an agreement, yet in contradiction to a good and right action, is wrong. ,Therefore, (8.) performing an ordinary marital act of sexual intercourse on an oral contraceptive pill is committing a wrong, because this sort of act falls under the latter case (7). ,Further clarification: taking the contraceptive pill is made sense of in the broader context of controlling birth, and in this sense it is like using a calendar-based method; but whereas a calendar-based method leaves infertile days as they are, taking the pill is intentionally making infertile what is naturally fertile. Thus it contradicts a good and right action (in the sense of (2) above). It contradicts the kind of action whose natural point is maintaining human life by (in this case) generating or transmitting it."
CMV: I have no personal reason to oppose CISA and similar bills (But I do for the sake of others),throwaway12_19asdft,Removed - Submission Rule E,3,43,"The fuss about CISA and the Patriot Act has honestly confused me, so I made an effort to learn more about them to understand why they should be opposed.,While I understand that there are definitely people that could be negatively affected by what these bills allow, I don't agree with the ""everyone is at risk"" statement. I do think if one has nothing to hide, there should be no fear of someone knowing what you do. All the articles and posts explaining why everyone should oppose these bills have said that deep down, every person has something they want to hide that the bill would bring to light.,Many have compared the information these bills bring up to being strip-searched against your will. I see absolutely no merit in this argument because I don't think of my naked body, which I use for intimacy with my partner and with which I associate with trust an emotion, and my internet passwords, which I use for checking emails, as the same thing. If someone has my passwords, they can see my bank accounts or medical history, sure. But these bills are allowing information to be sold to companies, not the public, yes? If someone were to steal my identity, they would be facing more job violations than privacy laws. They could bankrupt me and ruin my credit, but it's not the worst thing in the world to rent apartments or buy in cash.,About potential jobs being able to know that you broke client confidentiality or seeing your naked pictures- I'm unable to work so that doesn't apply to my situation, though I definitely see it as an issue. I think posting pictures online voids any right to privacy you have to that picture. Anyone can see it and use it however they want, even claiming it's theirs and earning money off it. If there isn't a watermark big enough to ruin the picture, it's fair game. ,I'm well aware that any internet user could be at home jerking off to my pictures, but it wouldn't affect my personal life in any way. It could be made public that I sent naked pictures to an ex in the past, but it's hardly an uncommon thing to do and it wouldn't ruin any political or personal standings I have. ,I'm not military or in Witness Protection, nor am I of any minority commonly discriminated against. The only laws I've ever broken are minor and I keep my more radical opinions to myself.,What I'm saying isn't that privacy isn't important overall, it's that not everyone has something to hide, like every article against the Patriot Act/CISA has claimed.,Possibly ironic throwaway because of the common idea that privacy is morally important and the amount of people that are quick to anger if you don't share the idea."

The politicians passing these laws should be charged triple. ,With all of these unscrupulous laws undercutting a woman's right to choose, it creates a financial burden that I, as a tax payer, am unwilling to shoulder. ,I'm overweight. I have a mental illness. I'm high risk. So I pay higher premium for insurance(s) to equalize the risk amongst the group. ,But here we have a population of citizens who want to 'potentially' create a greater financial burden for me. ,You know the mother doesn't want the burden. Perhaps she chooses to not pass a burden to her child. Unfortunately, lives are translated in dollars in our economy, so under that rule I want those who create greater burden to pay more. ,Let's say a woman is forced to give birth to a handicapped child. I had a handicapped cousin who easily cost the State and Fed 15 million dollars over his 32 years on Earth. And this was a kid who had no chance of being a financial asset and (people is his position) he lived 15 years past his life expectancy. ,I loved the guy. He was great. But we like to translate lives to dollars; anti-abortionists are cold blooded about consequences, so they need to pony up to the table.,If you buy into Levitt and Freakonomics, he makes the case the abortion is heavily correlated to a drop in crime. Some argued back that it could be lead, but in light of data I want to err on it being abortion - if not because being forced into having a child by the State becomes a burden. Otherwise aborted kids could be legally orphaned and who pays?  Me, you, everyone who supports a woman's right to choose. ,Someone needs to pay for the women who get things done illegally. They'll commit this illegal action, then end up in the ER further raising HC costs. ,There's a groundswell of support for male financial abortion. This would become moot. The father would have no choice BUT to pay. That's a little worse than how it currently works. ,If abortion is a crime, there has to be punishment. Alrighty, who's paying these legal costs?  Me and you. ,I want costs down, they want costs up. Tax them more. "
"CMV: US, and perhaps global economy, does not work.",SUBWAYJAROD,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,42,"Any time I talk about forms of economy someone brings up communism and how it looks good on paper, but never worked. I don't know about that system in depth, nor do I have much interest in it. ,I believe a free-market, capitalist society like what we have in the US - also does not perform as it would on paper. And I think it is harmful to think that it does.,Hyper-competition, regulation, and voting are the main things that steer me toward this belief. News/journalism seems to be the main source of public knowledge. Because these industries cater to different groups of people, the individuals will often flock towards whatever they agree with - and remain in an echo chamber of their own ideas. In a high competitive environment, more people = more money. Because of this, click-bait dominates the internet, and advertising insists that no matter what it is, their product can bring you closer to what you really want. ,In comes regulation. A smart group of people looked into the facts and realized a business was making false claims. Legal process breaks the claims up into bits and from all of this the business complies. Terms and conditions may apply. Every product or service around us from toothbrushes to rent, has a big list of important things to agree to in order to use. Because a business can focus on its own list of terms, the average consumer could not possibly retain the information from every agreement - and my problem with this is that they do not have a choice. Or do they?,We all have a vote, how many of us actually use it? I think this is easier to understand with an analogy; a child is raised in a closed environment with their parents choosing what information the child receives. When this child grows up to leave this environment - do they really have the ability to think for themselves? My answer is no for the most part, and that it would take years for them to develop this ability - if they get the opportunity at all. The point is that individuals are molded by the world around them, and in a world of whoever spams the most - wins, every person is pushed to follow this pattern or be drowned by it. Maybe a few get lucky and get the privilege of climbing barrier after barrier to get to the truth. But how many people reaped profits from their efforts? It seems building walls across information just allows for profit to be made out of essentially nothing. No amount of regulation can stop a system that was never going to work in the first place.,Please change my view."

CMV: The world and the average person would be better off if we were fewer people on this earth,Roaul,Removed - Submission Rule E,17,22,"I was reading this thread which again confirmed my views on this matter. Being fewer people may decrease the overall BNP, but I'd say the average person would have a higher purchase power and simple jobs would pay more money because it wouldn't be any competition for ""low-paying"" jobs like today. It's true that political and economical system greatly affects this as well, but it's not the only explanation. Take China today, it's a capitalistic economy in 2014, and the competition is extremely high for all kinds of jobs hence why salaries are pressed down, especially for entry level positions. Now, take Denmark or Sweden, countries with a low population. They have until recently (because of extreme mass immigration) had good wages for low skilled jobs and plenty of openings. For example, a fresh high school graduate can get a 60,000 dollar/year work in the mines, and more with over time. Because the demand is very big but there are not so many people to press down wages, even if it's unskilled work that anyone can do. The same job in China barely pays subsistence level.,Another positive thing with keeping the population low is the environment. Fewer people means less polluted air. The fossil fuels can also be used for more generations without being depleted and give the people a higher living standard. Housing would be a lot cheaper with fewer people since more free land for everyone. Here again we can compare China to Sweden or why not Canada/USA. Housing in big cities in China are more expensive than a mansion in USA because of not enough free space.,Explain to me why the AVERAGE person benefits from an increasing population like many economists say? I never understood this for above reasons. Sure, the overall BNP will grow and CEO's will make higher profits because more people will buy their stuff, but the average person would have a worse time. Hence why I think the population of the world should decrease a lot so everyone can enjoy a decent standard of living without killing this planet. "

CMV: Your job is not a right and thus any associated benefits are not a duty for your employer. CMV.,ekjswim,Removed - Submission Rule E,10,20,"I have been thinking a lot about the ACA and recently watched the Last Week Tonight on the Hobby Lobby case which I disagreed quite a bit with. It brought up a lot of thoughts about what I think about the interaction between business, employees and government.,So my basic presumption is that your job is not a right, because if you do your job poorly your employer should have the ability to find a better employee (feel free to CMV here). Thus, the associated benefits associated with your job (read: heath insurance but also including pensions, paid vacation, etc.) are not duties to be provided by the employer, but rather , to incentivize better employees to work for that business.,It mostly stems from the idea that even if just theoretically, the basis of the Hobby Lobby case could dis-incentivize business. Say for example Hobby Lobby had lost its case in the Supreme Court. If the owners of the company were truly opposed to providing whatever certain contraception they had been forced to provide, they would close their doors or sell their company. Should this be an acceptable potential outcome?,Please be aware, I am NOT saying that health care is not a right (nor that employers do not have duties to their employees). I am saying it is not a duty of an employer to provide insurance or for a law to state employers must provide it. Rather health insurance should be, in regard to an employer, a benefit that should incentivize the type of employee to apply at the company. If a company didn't find they were getting enough, or skilled enough employees, the company could choose to alter its considerations and provide things they would not have otherwise. This puts the decision clearly in the hands of the company (and the market for labor). A universal healthcare could be provided by the government, and taxed for. ,Feel free to address the statements like ""My boss shouldn't control what I do with my body."" It seems a bit exclusive. I hear ""provide me additional benefits at your cost but if it isn't to my liking I would still rather keep this job and blame you for providing me more than pay but not enough stuff instead of taking my skills elsewhere."",I've been awake for a long time so I probably could've formatted this better but I think most of my thoughts are here. Is a job a right? Is employment as a general whole a right but not any specific job? Is it a duty for an employer to provide benefits like insurance, retirement plans/pensions, vacation etc. Am I incorrect that it could provide negative incentives to business? "

,All these links were submitted during the past WEEK. More and more I keep seeing articles like this and ZERO solutions. The clear reason for it is because apparently there IS no solution. Society as a whole will not accept not eating meat, taking bikes (since for a lot of people it's not even an option, buying more responsibly (ditto), etc. The message is evident: WE ARE DOOMED.,There is absolutely nothing that I can do (though I don't have a car and have vowed to never have children, which are probably the biggest two things you can do for the planet) and I cannot live in the best case scenario society:
All my entertainment is derived from technology, most people don't like my deep topics of conversation and I cannot reach their level (I don't care about sports, I don't care about the weather, I don't care about irrelevant events in the lives of others). I don't even like group activities. I will not be able to stand having to spend most of the day farming and hanging out with people I find utterly uninteresting.
Since I am such a loner I am utterly incapable of surviving a disaster scenario. Therefore, my best course of action is to live a solitary existence. I don't plan for the future since there is no future. Why get into debt to buy a house, since it will be worth nothing? Why plan for a long term career, since it will all collapse? Why raise a family, since it will be people I will have to defend and likely see slaughtered and raped in front of me, all cursing my name for not being able to defend them?
If there is no hope, why should I expect a tomorrow? I don't want to go out fighting, I see no point on it. I might as well just stay in my room and play videogames until the apocalypse and finally hang myself when the time comes. Why not follow this plan? Why not enjoy the money I have right now in buying fancy clothes for myself?

On one side, I hate the idea of Clinton winning after all the bullshit the DNC pulled to sabotage Sanders and the corruption Clinton represents. I personally believe corruption is the worst characteristic of politicians even more than bigotry and racism because at least you can see the bigotry and racism and attack it directly but you can't attack corruption because it takes place behind closed doors and it just rots society from the inside out. ,That being said, every time I start to warm up to the idea of Trump winning I just need to hear a Trump supporter speak and I lose complete faith in humanity.

I'm referring to their obsession with the word ,. I'm sure there are many other cases but this seems to be one of the most blatant. Incase you are unaware, cuck used to be most commonly used in porn and still is to denote white men letting black screw their wives. This correlates with their obsession with white guilt in which they insinuate that liberals will allow 3rd world immigrants to infiltrate their country and rape their women simply due to white guilt. It's a racist term they try to hide under the dictionary definition of the word. I'm not buying it. They keep adopting these extremely racist buzzwords and then claiming ignorance when called out on it. Like the (((echoes))) and affiliation with the alt-right who are openly white nationalist. To me this screams of deception. If Trump wins these people will go full Nazi. If they are doing this kind of shit whilst trying to promote their candidate imagine what they'll do when he wins. They'll probably start waving Nazi flags and claiming it represents the original swastika of the Hindus which represented peace. "

Ive often felt as though religion fills a need in our psychology by serving as a conduit for how we cope with lifethe human condition, which, given its uniqueness in the animal canon, lends itself to the idea that our own perceptions of Earth, as well as earthly experiences, are vastly different than our co-inhabitant organisms. ,So if God and religion are concepts invented by humans for whatever reason our species would need to invent a subject like that, what does this say overall about a species which believes, at the very least, in the idea that a Creator put us here on Earth under the conditions and situations to which we are in? I see these beliefs reflecting upon the universe a broad kind of egotism exemplified by the human-centered nature and structure defined by most organized religions. ,More clearly, the basic tenant of most religions on Earth is the belief that Man was , by said , in said , image, which I think reflects the egotism I speak of: The belief in the notion that we are the sole supreme beneficiaries of this vast universe, created in the image of its sole creator. I wonder this, trying to find the outside view looking in, looking at it as one would if they were to be confronted with a species like ours that operates in the way we do. Im not making a statement that religion or belief in God is cause for all the ill on our planet or in our universe; I merely ponder its presence in our species and what it suggests about us."
CMV: Every living person in the world is unhappy.,sigma5s,Removed - Submission Rule E,0,44,"I'm not including kids (although they can be unhappy). I'm talking about people who are outside of school. I see phoney smiles in pictures, phoney enthusiasm, phoney advice...etc...It seems like people act like they're happy around others to show that they are ""happy"" and that their life is good but in reality, they are just as unhappy as everyone else. I'm talking about the rich and the poor. Its hard for poor people to act happy but rich people seem like the biggest fakers of happiness. Its almost as if everyone wants to be the other person's envy. In other words, they want others to envy them. Its because they are so unhappy with their own lives that they think if other people envy them, they can fool others away from the truth, that they hate their own life. But I think its pointless because, again, everyone is roughly experiencing the same unhappiness, regardless of wealth.,EDIT: After reading your comments, I'll change my view a little. Which is this: Every living person is experiencing roughly the same happiness/unhappiness; Regardless of wealth, working/unemployed, single/married, kids/no kids. Despite what anyone says, or does. This is because happiness/unhappiness is not appended to physical objects; but it is to states of mind(making 50$/day will make a rich man unhappy, a poor man happy; therefore $50 itself doesn't matter). Humans have relatively the same hardware and software, therefore, it is impossible to experience higher levels of happiness than other humans; So no matter what you do, you will never be happier than you are now. Whatever made you happy before, will no longer make you happy and whatever made you unhappy before will be replaced with something else.,So happiness/unhappiness seems irrelevant."

Things like ""you're the only [person of this race] I've ever been attracted to!"" are also grossly offensive.,Obviously there is no such mindset when people say ""I am only sexually attracted to [gender]"". No one calls you sexist or a bigot for being monosexual (straight or gay).,Why does this double-standard exist when it comes to romance but not for job opportunites, education, and politicians?,Both are judging someone for who they are on the outside. A person's race and gender is something they were born with/they didn't choose/they can't easily change.,Even though I genuinely ""feel"" that it isn't sexist to be monosexual, I still haven't found an arguement convincing enough to make me think otherwise.

I rounded a cul de sac to return on opposite side of road and a girl in pajamas that wasn't there previously was walking to the end of the driveway and by the time I got close she was standing at the edge inches from the road. This girl was definitely less than 5; would say 4 if I had to guess. There was absolutely no one around and no visible life in the yard or house in immediate vicinity.,My immediate thought was this kid got out of the house while a parent wasn't paying attention so I asked her where she lived and she pointed. I thought she pointed at the house of the yard she was in but as I started to walk to the door she said ""no no over there"" pointing to the house next door.,I walked over there--she followed; never touched her--knocked on the door and she walked past and rang the door bell. When a guy answered I told him I found this girl at the road and his reply was ""she's not mine; she lives over there""--pointing at the yard we previously were in.,He asked his wife(?) to take her home and then said ""that stupid bitch""--referring to the neighbor--and we left it at that. As I started to run off the girl was on her way home in an obviously friendly neighbor's care.,After that I just couldn't help but feel like I wish I had seen the parent personally to get a feel if this was a one-time mistake or a common occurrence--a response of ""oh shit!"" versus ""so what?"". At that point I had decided to go back later today and just check up and then decide from there if I should report the matter or not. I've since decided to leave it alone.,Obviously I'm not wanting to get anyone in trouble for a mistake which is why it never crossed my mind to call authorities until after I've had chance to talk to parents. I posted this story (very slimmed down and without this much detail which I now regret) to another subreddit and was chided for even stopping in the first place by some which really got me thinking and leads me to the question:,Should a kid of 4 be allowed to play without a fence, inches from a road, without someone in at least eyesight? My concern was the girl's safety first and foremost but to some I apparently crossed a line by even stopping. I don't allow my two younger kids out of eyesight in the front yard (3 and 2 y/o) and didn't when my oldest (now 9) was that age. Obviously this is a judgement call by the parent if it was intentional but IMO a kid of 4 is just a little too unaware of surroundings to be left to their own doing next to a road."

Most of their victims are innocent people, and they should be helped.,I am not interested in debating previous US roles in Middle East governance - for example, our support of the shah in Iran, our continued support of the Saudi kingdom, or Musharraf in Egypt.  I agree, the US has played some dubious roles and at times, has not contributed to the greater good in the Middle East.  I'd like to limit the scope of conversation to only consider relevant, recent happenings in Syria, Iraq and with regard to ISIS.,That said, I recognize it's all a complex mess, so I'll likely even reference things out of my own scope during discussion...  But let's try to focus on the here and now.,My assertion is that the extremism projected by ISIS is the logical and predictable outcome of typical Middle East governance.,The Saudis, conservative sunnis, are , left and right - recently even for the crime of ,.,In Iran, the government , everything it is able and , people for all manners of ""crimes"" including ,.,If you have access to the internet, and are interested in reading about, or discussing the Middle East, you certainly know it only gets worse...  Egypt has been known to routinely torture prisoners, many political.  In Dubai, a pair of British tourists can be convicted for kissing in public.  I believe it was the UAE where another British tourist was arrested and held for using foul language in public (I recall there was an argument with a taxi driver or something).  The list goes on, and on, and on...,I'm not making any disparaging remarks about the populations or character of people in these countries.  Instead, I am talking about their governance and legal systems.  These countries are backward, religiously oppressed, corrupt, breeding grounds for extremism.  They use violence and religion to control populations with threat of violence.  To keep these tools effective, they fund and encourage extremism in schools and pursue oppression in public.,As a result, a lot of people have been raised in an environment where it's OK to believe that someone is guilty of sorcery and they should be beheaded.  The same people believe it's OK to treat women and children like property.  The same people believe in supernatural, apocalyptic futures.  The same people are willing to turn a blind eye to the exact form of violence that ISIS is delivering to the regions under their control.,It seems to me that ISIS is a logical outcome from such conditions.  They've taken some of the fairy tales and and psychopathy to an extreme - a logical extreme, given that they've been taught to believe this crazy garbage in public and tolerated the entire time.  Keep in mind, that where ISIS goes, they find supporters.  It's not like they're a limited army of a few thousand guys - they pick up support in the communities under their control.,I say we let them fester and grow.  Obama has said they're a cancer - I agree.  But perhaps the governments in the Middle East could use a scare, in order to adopt a healthier lifestyle.  I say we pull out all together and let it all go to hell.  If the other governments think Islamism and brutality are good for populations, then hey - ISIS is just as valid a government as they are.  I think ISIS is their problem, and they should sort it out.,Instead, the US should take any money not spent bombing these cavemen and instead spend it on screening people traveling into and out of the region.  We need to keep the US safe, sure.  Let's do that by keeping the lunatics over there.  Hey - maybe we can create more jobs...  hey, maybe we can help poverty here at home...,And for the record, I'm perfectly willing to pay more for my gas and merchandise as a result of chaos in the Middle East.

People who are negatively affected by secondhand smoke get none of the pleasures of smoking, but still get the drawbacks. Things that negatively affect others, especially in public, should be illegal. Over 50,000 people die annually in the U.S alone, because of secondhand smoke, so it is not like secondhand smoke is just a nuisance. I am okay with people smoking in private places, because that only negatively affects them and the people who chose to be around them, getting the effects of secondhand smoke in this case are optional.

CMV: Child abuse has become too broad a category in recent decades.,PillowPalsy,Removed - Submission Rule E,1,7,"I think a lot of people who claim to be abused nowadays, are really just being whiny. Obviously not all are, and I'm not saying I don't think child abuse is a thing, but a lot of people see their childhood through a distorted and negative lens. Parents can be flawed people, but if you can only see the negative in others, that is a flaw in you.,Most people face some sort of childhood trauma. Most people get over it. Whether a person attributes the word ""trauma"" to their experience determines what kind of person they are in a lot of ways. So people who claim to have nothing traumatic and a good childhood, could've had an objectively worse childhood and more traumatic experiences than someone who considers themselves traumatized.,If your parents don't pose a threat to you as an adult, there is no reason to be mad at them. No reason to attribute your current failings to them. You set the boundaries of your relationship now.

cmv: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DEBATE BETWEEN PRO AND ANTI ABORT,Alexandros6,Removed - Submission Rule C,0,103,"I will try to be short since I am on mobile,I don't see the usefulness of the debate between pro and anti abort.
I've had myself the discussion of abortion many times, so from my experience at the end all arguments from one side and the other boild down to this,For the atheist life doesn't begin at such an early age and therefore it isn't baby murder
For the cristhian life as said by God already starts at that age and therefore abortion is murder.,Now the reason because I think this argument is useless is that when the cristhians has an unwanted baby they will not abort because of their beliefs,The atheists if they want will abort,Neither of the 2 sides damages the other by choosing to abort or not to abort. And why should the atheist try to convince the cristhian to abort? Its her belief and choice and why should the cristhian try to convince the atheist? Since its their own decision the question becomes why should the cristhian force any of their beliefs on the atheist? No one goes around saying they should ban people the possibility to celebrate cristhmas, or to enter a church if they are not cristhians. So why do people do it for abortion?,There is a easy solution for all this, give people the choice to abort, people who believe won't do it, and people who don't will do it.,I am asking myself if I am missing something, hope to have an insightful conversation.,Sorry for the bad English but its not my first language,Edit various discussions have explained to me why cristhians find abortion a problem, but I haven't understood what brings them to this opinion in the first place, why do they think its murder?"
CMV: Holding firearm manufacturers financially liable for crimes is complete nonsense,babno,Removed - Submission Rule B,521,802,"I don't see how it makes any sense at all. Do we hold doctors or pharmaceutical companies liable for the ~60,000 Americans that die from their drugs every year (~6 times more than gun murders btw)? Car companies for the 40,000 car accidents?,There's also the consideration of where is the line for which a gun murder is liable for the company. What if someone is beaten to death with a gun instead of shot, is the manufacture liable for that? They were murdered with a gun, does it matter how that was achieved? If we do, then what's the difference between a gun and a baseball bat or a golf club. Are we suing sports equipment companies now?,The actual effect of this would be to either drive companies out of business and thus indirectly banning guns by drying up supply, or to continue the racist and classist origins and legacy of gun control laws by driving up the price beyond what many poor and minority communities can afford, even as their high crime neighborhoods pose a grave threat to their wellbeing. ,I simply can not see any logic or merit behind such a decision, but you're welcome to change my mind."
CMV: Andrew Tate is a con-man with poor takes.,mementoTeHominemEsse,Removed - Submission Rule B,39,119,"I get that this isn't exactly an extremely unpopular opinion, but I did see a Reddit poll suggesting that around a quarter of redditors (that is redditors who know him) support him, and on other social media cites, such as TikTok, I say it could far exceed that. ,First of all, if you don't know Tate, he is a right wing multi-millionaire and retired kickboxing champion who has been all over social media in the past months, especially TikTok.,First of all, lets approach his online course, called ""Hustlers University"". For those of you who haven't heard of it, Tate basically claims he will make you rich and ""wake you up from the matrix"" if you only by his course at a whimsical price of 50$ per month! He claims that ""getting rich is easy"" if you only follow his advice. Already, red flags all over the place. Even just the name is a turn-off. ,Once you buy this program you will have access to to different courses, some of them quite ridiculous like the "",imping ,oes ,rogram"" (abbreviation ,), but also some serious ones like crypto or stocks. Each course has an accompanying discord server, and each ""course"" is just a video series you can watch for free on YouTube. Tate commonly uses one of two arguments to get people to sign up: For one, he says that there have been profits as high as 10k. But here's the thing, 100,000 people have signed up for the course. If you told 100k people to go to the casino and play roulette there'd be some people making 10k profit. If Tate actually wanted to make a convincing argument he would have to show high , profits, not the outliers. Argument number 2 claims that him retaining 100k people , that it's worth it, otherwise, why wouldn't people just leave? Quite simple actually, because he himself actively calls people that leave stupid, and the people in his course obviously think a lot of him, otherwise they wouldn't have bought the course in the first place. And also, doesn't everyone have subscriptions they're too lazy to cancel? And look, even if you do subscribe to his fishy university and do make 10k, you've not been awoken from any ""matrix"". All you've done is followed the herd trying to make money by selling crypto, stocks, or doing numerous other things that don't provide any value to society.,As for his takes, a lot of them are sexist. He has called ""females"" ""barely sentient"", unintelligent, and ""incompetent"". He claimed that a woman's body belongs to her partner, but not vice versa. Additionally, he claimed he doesn't want to be flown or driven by a female, as he claims they are much more likely to get into a vehicular crash. The list goes on. He usually defends himself by saying that he thinks men are good at things and women are good at other things so he's not sexist, but the only positive things I've ever seen him say about women is that they're beautiful and that they're better nurses and caretakers. ,He also has some gender-unrelated takes that are imho pretty awful: He is anti-mask, claims therapy is stupid, claims that if you're poor without a physical disability you're just lazy, claims your depression will go away if you only just get abs (lol), is opposed to fighting climate change, etc.. ,But it's not his takes themselves that annoy me; it's the reasoning (or rather lack thereof) he employs to reach his conclusions. His sexist takes he usually premises by saying something along the lines of ""men and women are different"" and pretending that that's controversial, and then just flatout concludes that therefore women are in some major way inferior without any further reasoning. On some occasions he backs his thesis with even more thesises, but there's never any real argument. He is incredibly prone to logical fallacies, especially the black swan and the anecdotal fallacy. The black swan fallacy is him saying ""I employed these strategies and they made me rich, therefore these strategies will make you rich"". This is akin to saying that if you go swimming you will be eaten by a shark, since there are people who go swimming and are eaten by sharks. The anecdotal fallacy is quite self-explanatory: He uses anecdotes instead of data to prove his point. Sometimes even just a quick google search can disprove his point entirely. Car crashes by sex are worth looking up, for instance.,And what really grinds my gears is that he's now reverted to religion, and claims he is one of Gods ""favorites"". Even his submissive boyfriend Adin Ross made fun of him on that front. Tate claims he's literally perfect when pride is a sin, got rich by being a literal pimp and scammer, preaches and lives out hedonism, is greedy for money, has multiple women, and certainly isn't the person to show the other cheek. God detests him."

It's far deeper than simply highlighting the number of migrants Texas is being asked to absorb. It's deliberately singling out liberal cities, which promote open borders and function as ""sanctuary cities"" (e.g., New York State now gives driver licenses and a substitute form of unemployment insurance to unlawful immigrants, and protects them from discrimination in things like housing and public accommodations).  While lack of adequate enforcement at the border is one precondition for illegal migration, policies like New York States' are one of the magnets that drive illegal migration.  It's setting up a situation in which these bastions of cosmopolitan liberalism very publicly and visibly have to struggle to deal with the results of their own promoted policies, revealing their radicalism as they tend to deal with the issue impracticably and certainly without any regard for the black letter of immigration law, while at the same time riffing on the inherent opposition between cosmopolitan coastal cities and middle America.  Since the typical American voter is not comfortable with the New York City or Washington, D.C. way of dealing with the issue, putting the practices of those cities right in public view drives electoral politics in a way beneficial to Abbott's party."

Surely such innocent and benign child-friendly media would remain virtually untouched in the localization process right?,Oh you sweet summer child,See due to the difference in culture Japan has much more lenient standards on whats appropriate to show to little kids - at least compared with America at the time. Yet even then some things remained universal, the Queer romances featured in Sailor Moon for instance were as chaste as any Disney Renaissance Romance film at the time if not chaster. ,But I understand if America simply wasnt ready to introduce the concept of two mommies or daddies to their preschoolers, it was the 90s after all.,But theres still no excuse for not just simply removing these characters/relationships but actively , them straight instead, and there are three instances where this happens in the original DIC Sailor Moon dub (DIC was a subsidiary of Disney, so technically Sailor Moon was originally licensed and localized by Disney, my have times changed indeed if were going from a world where Disney actively straight-washed queerness in their licenses to outright , it.),All these instances I mentioned go beyond just mere censorship and into straight-out (pun intended) heterosexual propaganda, so dont talk to me about chaste LGBT content in kids media being used to indoctrinate kids when anime dubbing companies of the 90s were hypocritically doing the same thing. Id like to see if anyone can explain to me why the above was okay yet its somehow propaganda for kids to see a lesbian kiss in the new Buzz Lightyear movie? Id be interested in seeing if anyone can justify how the above three examples , in fact, blatant heterosexual propaganda and indoctrinating kids into being straight when they couldve just as easily left well enough alone and edit out the scenes altogether rather than leaving them mostly the same just with a straight altercation. ,Why is Buzz Lightyear considered gay propaganda but the above examples arent hetero propaganda? Why is it only propaganda when Disney creates original queer scenes but not when they localize existing characters into being straight? Propaganda is Propaganda, either criticize all instances of it or just admit that you hold homophobic double standards because I assure you it wouldve been , more sanitizing for the kids if they just edited out all allusions to romance in general with these scenes/characters."
CMV: American Democracy is at severe risk of collapse within the decade.,Ok_Piccolo_5135,Removed - Submission Rule B,15,131,"My argument is very simple. ,The American Republican Party (Representatives, at bare minimum) has firmly established themselves as an anti-democratic body within the past few decades, with a significant ramp-up in efforts to realize an anti-democratic government system in the past decade especially.

Well you can say the same thing about the Democrats! [Insert completely incomparable, non-parallel example of Democrat policy prescription here].,-January 6th was not a coup attempt. There was virtually no extreme violence relative to the crowd/it was a stunt/where were all the weapons? etc.,-The Democrats made power grabs too! (With none being overtly , in nature.),¦and more grasping a straws for ways to convince people that our government cannot fall and take a very bloody turn for the worst at the drop of a hat.,I am of the opinion at this point that the common Nazi comparisons that tend to arise in political conversations (generally from the Left) are , unrealistic; given verifiable, archived and heavily broadcasted information across years of history and research into uncovering the social science behind authoritarianism, fascism, and general anti-democracy. People are quick to see this as a buzzword and say: Oh, you think everyone is a Nazi. ,I do not mean Nazi in the sense of the , violent iteration that we see in Holocaust media or discussions in class. I mean it in the sense of a prolific party of people that was not at all immune to the influence of authoritarianism despite hailing from a largely progressive democracy during their time.

These comparisons are realistic in my opinion. ,All this said, I believe that America at present is at immense risk of internal destruction, potentially within the decade.

Even though not everyone in a socialist movement may agree on exactly on how to implement a socialist state after the revolution, everyone agrees that the downfall of the rich must happen ,.,And that's precisely what happened in the communist revolutions.,The rich were evicted from power / persecuted / jailed, but the movements largely fall apart due to a lack of universal consensus on how to implement a socialist state. Initial popular support crumbles after the 'enemies' are removed, and resentment rises against the controlling group because most people don't get exactly the kind of socialism that they wanted. The revolution deviates from the original vision due to practical reasons and it becomes a perversion of what most people would consider ""socialism"" in its purist form.,I genuinely think this is probably what would happen to most major socialists movements, particularly those that are driven by hatred of the rich. Even if a movement claims that it does not hate the rich, this notion sort of occurs incidentally by the nature of socialism itself (whether by the rhetoric used or other features of campaigning for socialism), and it's the most salient and popular feature of the ideology.,I think if socialism remotely has a chance to work, I think it should be primarily motivated by a communal desire and widespread cultural values to help the poor. Rather than investing energy into 1% protests (which IMO is strictly all about hating the rich; everyone including people at the 51% percentile should be actively helping the poor), we should proactively be pooling resources into community chests and and community organizations to help the least fortunate members of their own communities. We should be encouraging people regardless of their level of income (whether you are at the 30th percentile or the 75th percentile) to volunteer and contribute to helping the lowest percentile."

If they either get all of it, or get more of it by the end of the game, they win. Examples of acquisition games: Risk, Trivial Pursuit, Checkers, and Monopoly.,I'm not familiar with every board game that exists, but every board game I know about can be classified as one or the other.,Edit: to clarify my definitions, it doesn't have to be the case that one player is, for example, racing against the others.

CMV: We are entering an unhealthy culture of needing to identify with a 'label' to be justified in our actions,TheMayoVendetta,Removed - Submission Rule B,"5,537",656,"I was recently reading a BBC opinion article that identified a list of new terms for various descriptors on the spectrum of asexuality. These included: asexual, ace, demisexual, aromantic, gray-sexual, heteroromantic, homoromantic and allosexual. This brought some deeper thoughts to the surface, which I'd like to externalise and clarify.,I've never been a fan of assigning labels to people. Although two people are homosexual, it doesn't mean they have identical preferences. So why would we label them as the primary action, and look at their individual preferences as the secondary action?,I've always aimed to be competent in dealing with grey areas, making case-specific judgements and finding out information relevant to the current situation. In my view, we shouldn't be over-simplifying reality by assigning labels, which infers a broad stereotype onto an individual who may only meet a few of the stereotypical behaviours. ,I understand the need for labels to exist - to make our complex world accessible and understandable. However, I believe this should be an external projection to observe how others around us function. It's useful to manage risks (e.g. judge the risk of being mugged by an old lady versus young man) and useful for statistical analysis where detailed sub-questioning isn't practical.,I've more and more often seen variants of the phrase , in social media and publications (such as this BBC article). The article is highlighting this in a positive, heart-warming/bravery frame. ,This phrase makes me uneasy, as it feels like an extremely unhealthy way of perceiving the self. As if they weren't real people until they felt they could be simplified because they're not introspective enough to understand their own preferences. As if engaging with reality is less justified than engaging with stereotypical behaviour. As if the preferences weren't obvious until it had an arbitrary label assigned - and they then became suddenly clear. And they are relatively arbitrary - with no clear threshold between the categories we've used to sub-divide what is actually a spectrum. To me, life-changing relief after identifying with a label demonstrates an unhealthy coping mechanism for not dealing with deeper problems, not developing self-esteem, inability to navigate grey areas and not having insight into your own thoughts. Ultimately, inability to face reality.,As you can see, I haven't concisely pinned down exactly , I have a problem with this new culture of 'proclaiming your label with pride'. In some sense, I feel people are projecting their own inability to cope with reality onto others, and I dislike the trend towards participating in this pseudo-reality. Regardless, I would like to hear your arguments against this perspective.,: Sorry for being slow to catch up with comments. I'm working through 200+ direct replies, plus reading other comments.

"CMV: The mockery of Tucker Carlson's ""End of Men"" trailer is toxic.",tearsofthepenis,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,113,"For the uninitiated: ,Basically, Tucker Carlson is making a special about this notion that ""masculinity is under attack"".,The trailer for the special depicts a lot of fit men working out.,Apparently, an interest in male fitness and physiques is ""gay"". Here's just some of the reactions people have had.,""This is actually real. Evidently he likes men without shirts, which may explain the Putin obsession,"" Republican Rep. , ,.,Writer Mark Harris wrote: ""I am sitting here next to my gay husband living my gay life reading a gay novel as research for my new gay book...and yet I am not and will never be as gay as whatever is haunting Tucker Carlson's fantasies."",""This is so gay,"" quipped actor George Takei.,I find this to be an annoying, toxic quality amongst many people. I've been training brazilian jiu jitsu for quite some time. You can see some guys grappling in tucker's video. I've probably heard the same ""joke"" from dozens of people. It goes like: ""grappling is gay, why would a straight guy roll around with a shirtless dude"". Apparently I'm ""gay"" if I enjoy wrestling with men.,Okay. Now let's talk about ""shirtless men"". I'm also a big fan of bodybuilding. I've read ""the wild physique"" by Vince Gironda three times cover to cover. The pages are filled with very muscular, shirtless men. I genuinely marvel and feel inspired by the likes of Mohamed Makkawy and Larry Scott (and the iron guru himself, of course). The idea that I'm ""gay"" because I admire these men is so backwards.,Toxic, to me, is when you take something that is otherwise good or positive, such as guys working out or wrestling (what's wrong with physical fitness?) and turn it into a pejorative. You could have made this montage from my suggested videos on youtube or instagram. Apparently, my interests are gay and I'm probably a closeted homosexual.,Some will argue that these media figures are just taking the piss out of Tucker by making fun of his promo and calling him gay is a good way to do this because Tucker Carlson is supposed to hate gays. Cool, politics, glad they're having fun. They're still being toxic by pretending that celebrating male physiques and camaraderie are only for closet gays. It perpetuates these same jokes I've heard before.,If I showed these guys my copy of the wild physique, would they make fun of me and say something like, ""boy, you sure like shirtless men, right?"". Based off this story, most certainly, for that they're toxic.,It's not gay that I admire men of great physical proportions. It's not gay that I enjoy wrestling with shirtless men. If you think it is gay, or even a little gay, you're toxic.,I'd love to hear from some gay people on this too. Doesn't it bother you that you're being stigmatized as hypersexual? ""Oh look, shirtless men, must be gay"". Isn't that insulting? Isn't that toxic?,But maybe you can convince me I'm wrong. Maybe there is nothing toxic about calling someone gay for making a show about masculinity and insinuating that focusing on the male physique comes from a homoerotic obsession with men.,Edit 1: I want to make clear that I do not believe gay = bad. It's just bad manners/toxic to call a thing something gay that isn't gay. Like... why do this? How is it acceptable? If someone can convince me that wrestling with men has some homosexual quality to it. Or body-building, I'll be convinced. Or even a shirtless man swinging an axe. From the video I saw, I did not see anything sexual whatsoever."

CMV: the anime community is the reason why most normal people can't bring them self to watch anime,niesamowityfilip,Removed - Submission Rule B,"10,166","1,069","As a teen I watched anime (I'm a twenty year old on reddit it sould be self explanotary). After a while I started to seek out people and communities on the internet that would share that interest. And one of the very first things I saw was a guy talking about how good pedofilia in anime was. The worst part is that most comments supported him in his belief.,There are a lot of stereotypes that relate to anime watchers or at least nerds in general, and the anime community does nothing to separate them self from it. I can remember a video by some big anime youtuber (I don't remember his name but he had a few hundred thousand subscribers) that was basically him talking about how drawing porn of underage girls was okay because they were just drawings. ,But let's not talk about pedofilia so much. So, a lot of anime fans are really sexist, like actually to a ridiculous extent. Anime is generally targeted towards teen boys so it doesn't make that much effort to develop or explore female characters (keep in mind that I'm not talking about every single show, I'm just saying that it is defintly a common thing). So a lot of anime fans treat woman like (most) anime treats it's female characters, that is to say with little to no respect. For specific examples just suggest that your are a girl on one of the numerous message boards, you will be floded with ever flavour of sexism there is.,The last problem doesn't seem like the worst, but it essentially creates ever other problem. The ,.  There are many kinds of elitism that anime fans like: ""my favorite show is better than yours"", ""you are enjoying/not enjoying an anime I dislike/like and there for I a a better person"",  ""you are not allowed to watch this specific show because (something sexist/rasist most probably)"", and of course ""As if you would even understand"". I feel like I don't have to go in depth with this one, the over the top examples show exactly how I feel.,The problem is that I like Anime, I'd even would co side my self a fan/web if not for the community. And I'd love to recommend shows like Evangelion, Beastars, cowboy Beebop, fullmeatl alchemist: Brotherhood, JoJo's etc. But I know that I will get the weird looks from them. ,To clarify I am not saying that every single anime fan is like this, just that a majority is like that. I know that the Lou.d minority allways makes the entire group look bad, but in this case it's often hard to find people who are not exactly like the weeb stereotypes.,Edit: okay, I had a lot of conversation with lots of people (never expected for this to get so big overnight). So writing a comment would be pretty pointless since I generally agree with you. I also think that it is because of anime it self rather than just the community that most people are turned off by .,I'd also like to say that Beastars, whole extremely good in my opinion,  is a really bad example of an anime that you could recommend to an average person LoL.
I also forgot to mention that I'd already consider most anime to be not that good. Not that the people who watch it are bad, but that the show them self make me cringe.,Edit 2: I feel like I learned quite a bit on the topic, and I discovered a plethora of reasons why people don't like anime (I know it sounds silly). Many people don't like animation, many people find anime to be too over the top, many anime courses people to become  these shitty fans rather then the opposite, sometimes it's just ignorance and not wanting to read subtitles/watch a foreign film, I also now realise that I was talking about a small vocal minority rather than the larger whole. And while I love to argue more (a big majority of you were kind and understanding while discussing) I have switched my view point so there isn't really a point to it. So I'm not going to respond to further arguments, I will also give deltas to people who persuaded me. Thanks."
"CMV: I am completely apathetic to the war in Ukraine. I don't have love for Russia at all but I also don't have love for countries that have, in the very recent past, denied asylum to Syrians and Africans and are denying black and brown people the ability to leave Ukraine right now.",BluSolace,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,77,"Honestly, I feel conflicted. On one hand I hate that Russia is invading this country and I want to support Ukraine in defending itself. On the other hand Ukraine and multiple European countries have treated African and middle eastern refugees like shit in the past and continue to do so now. What's funny about this is that many of the same European nations that are welcoming Ukraine refugees with open arms now we're the same ones who denied refugees from Syria and Africa in the past and they did so very openly. It seems that the tune changed once the skin color and ethnicity changed.
As it stands, there are reports of black and brown immigrants in Ukraine being denied the ability to leave the country. They are literally saying that only Ukrainians can get on trains and buses that are exfiltrating people. One news report even tells of an African man who was not only denied the ability to leave Ukraine but also told that he was going to be given a gun and that he was going to fight for Ukraine. How can I feel sorry for that country when it's people treat black and brown people this way? Why would this man fight for that country? 
Honestly, at this point I'm completely apathetic to this attack other than it's impact on the rest of the world. I've gone from caring about the Ukrainian people and government to primarily caring about how it will affect me in the US. This feeling is problematic to me but I can't change how I feel. Why should I care about a group of countries that have treated black and brown people so poorly when they were being ravaged by war? Especially considering that some of these countries also have a strong history of colonization on top of the other issues I have expressed here."
CMV: Cleromancy (casting lots) is a reasonable practice to gauge the undercurrents of the universe,josephfidler,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,80,"This is definitely going to run afoul of some people's sense of reason and science. I'm asking you to keep an open mind.,Our experience of consciousness strongly implies that there is something more than the physical world. It is not unreasonable to me to speculate that the same substrate or substrates in which our consciousness exists carry other things, and that these things might be able to affect the physical world, for example affect events like a wave function collapse, and maybe doing that in particular would entail less effort or energy or whatever the currency of consciousness is, or may happen consequentially without intent.,If there are any patterns to seemingly random events, looking into the most random events you know of may offer a window into what is going on behind the scenes.,For example, and these are just my pet topics, if spirits exist and are nonphysical, or if things existing in the future can affect the present through some means that is outside our physical models or truly outside the physical world, looking into what we would expect to be devoid of meaningful information may give an opportunity for either communication or observation.,But those are just two possibilities. There are myriad imaginable systems that might have subtle impacts. In fact separating signal from noise is an everyday and quite scientific process. The question is are there any signals from sources we don't know of? Isn't it reasonable to look? Isn't this fundamentally what SETI is about for example?,Obviously the interpretation is the tricky part. To do this with your mind is going to be very prone to confirmation bias and seeing what you want to see, or what your imagination produces. Also, if anyone were actually capable of doing this today in a verifiable, testable way, we would presumably already know about it. However, I don't assume humans are , stupid or deluded. There is a reason cleromancy has a long history in humanity and I think that is because it is not actually unreasonable in its premise.,I think whether through mental practices and learning, or through engineering and science, looking for patterns in what ought to be random could be a window into things we have been unable to answer otherwise."
CMV: Im so tired of conservative hypocrisy on big tech,Motivational_Quotes7,Removed - Submission Rule B,440,455,"Do these people even understand what theyve been fighting for in the past? So, its ok for a business to deny someone their service due to their sexual orientation, but a tech service cant ban someone for feeling that they violated their terms of service?,Throughout history conservatives have done nothing but defend big tech and private businesss freedoms. Hell, speaker Pelosi spoke on dismantling these monopolies of the tech industry, to which conservatives just ignored her because it posed no threat to them or just flat out called her, again, a socialist. Oh, but all of sudden it matters when it goes against the cult leader inciting violence. Now the big tech need dismantled! ,Even if you dont think Donald Trump incited violence, its undeniable that disinformation from the president has caused this insurrection, as the entire basis of the riot was on non-existent voter fraud. Twitter knows that Trump is tied to this violence through the use of their platform, and so they sought to have it banned. If I were Trump, I wouldve been banned a long time ago...,Im just so angry at how conservatives have completely abandoned their values as soon as it affects them. Stimulus check? Socialism until its not. Censorship? Good when its , or Parler but bad when going against conservative disinformation. Big tech monopolies? Good when paying off conservative senators but bad when against the cult. ,I already knew conservatives have been disingenuous with their beliefs in actual practical application, but this is just ridiculous. Twitter actually doing the right thing and showing the positives of private corporation freedoms has somehow been misconstrued as bad by the right. Is Twitter allowed to ban anyone anymore or is that against conservatism?,Edit: , made a good point that I think I should address in my original post that my point of hypocrisy is against the conservatives with political influence/power that have collectively lost their shit against big tech these past couple of days. Calling every conservative a hypocrite is definitely misconstruing many peoples beliefs.,Edit 2( PLEASE READ): These have been some great responses and honestly I have to say my viewpoint has been shifted a bit. The bakery example wasnt entirely accurate to the courts decision and while I still dont agree with those arguing for the freedoms of businesses to discriminate on the basis of LGBT+ status, I understand that the case was more about religious freedoms than discrimination. ,I also misunderstood the conservative point of allowing for these tech companies to still enact their TOS while still criticizing their biases in the application of these TOS. Of course you shouldnt use the platform if its going against your beliefs, and to say I misunderstood that point is an understatement. Thank you for awesome discussions and real responses to my post. Hopefully this edit goes through,Edit 3: The question of if Trump was inciting violence is basically one of whether or not Trumps disinformation and vague defense of the rioters are enough to say it was inciting the violence. To be completely honest I dont know the legal side of what determines inciting violence from a public figure so to me this issue should be solved through the impeachment and trial of Donald Trump brought by the dems. I seriously doubt it will do much but it will be interesting to hear the legal prosecution. ,The real question in my mind is should we allow for misinformation from the president to lead to this point of radicalization? ,(Also, not interested in discussing election fraud. Its bullshit. Thats not a viewpoint I think can be changed and Ill be honest in that. There is no evidence and I will continue to call it misinformation as it has been shown to be just that. Sorry if that pisses some people of but dont waste your time.),Edit 4: Appeal successful! Ill finally say through the discussions had that I feel that I misunderstood the conservative position of dealing with how they would deal with big tech and that the analogy to the cake case wasnt entirely accurate. ,Reading the case, while I do understand the reasoning of the court, I will also quote Kennedy on this: the outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market"".,Ill also say that in regards to the solution of how to deal with big tech I dont truly know how effective the conservative just leave Twitter option would actually be in dealing with the issues we are currently seeing. I also dont know the accuracy of the banning of the Conservatives fear because, to be completely honest, its like the kid crying wolf at this point. Liberal bias in media is just getting ridiculous to prove at this point, and reading further studies I just dont believe in the accuracy of this fear mongering. ,Did trump incite violence? Probably. And that probably is enough for him to concede the election minutes after the violence. That probably is what might him get impeached. Twitter is well within its rights to ban an individual in this sort of situation from their platform, especially if they believe that individual had used their platform for that incitement.,Ill also say to those who are in doubt of if Trump incited violence, I will ask you to consider just the amount of power the president has. We seem to forget that Trump has a massive amount of influence in this country, and incitement under the law is understood by the knowledge of the individual of the imminent violence that could occur with their speech. Phrases such as If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore strongly implies some conflict to occur, and thats just one example of the many analogies to war that were made during the rally. ,Personally, I cannot believe Trump is ignorant to how his rhetoric incited violence. Again, as I said earlier Ill still wait for the impeachment to play out but its just hard for me to believe Trump is ignorant to the influence his words would have in causing the imminent violence after the stop the steal rally."

In theory, fish shouldn't be terrible on pizza. Maybe a nice salmon bake, maybe some crab. It could work.,But it didn't.,But did Big Anchovy remove the product from market? No. The contracts were already in place. Pizza suppliers already owned the fish so they did their best to use it.,Once the contracts ran out, though, Big Anchovy wasn't doing so well since pizza places weren't ordering any more. But what's worse, anchovy pizza's been totally demonized and no one... NO ONE is buying it anymore.,The last thing Big Anchovy needs is their respective brands being hated on. So they come up with an ingredient that could never work and start marketing it: pineapple.,The idea is, if Big Anchovy can get people to hate on pineapple pizza more than anchovy pizza, they can distract from all the hate they get and keep out of the negative attention and bide their time for when Big Anchovy can do a relaunch, maybe in a few years.,The problem is, for some reason, people ended up loving pineapple on pizza. Now, I'm not here to argue for or against pineapple on pizza. I get the idea behind the flavor combinations. I get why some may like it and others not and for the purposes of this post, I'm taking a completely neutral stance on it.,Big Anchovy, though, is still up to their old games. They constantly make posts and memes taking both sides of the argument in the pro/anti pineapple debate, increasing rhetoric and polarization simply for the purpose of misdirecting the hate of the people away from anchovy pizza.,And it's working. Friends have fallen out. Marriages ended. Families torn apart. And for what? So a Big Anchovy company's stock can increase by a quarter of a point."

But I'll try to defend it anyway.,First, it's cool. Aren't you bored with all denominations being divisors or multiples of 100? Haven't you ever wanted to have 6 dollar coins or 64 euro bills? Well,  dollars is even greater. I'm not sure you can change my mind here, honestly.,Second, sure, it will be confusing to a lot of people. Hell, some apparently think  symbolizes infinity, they'll be bewildered. But it won't take long to get used to. I realize it will still be annoying for most even after that. But it's a minor inconvenience, and there is a big upside. Namely, the kids who get introduced to interesting mathematics early, and get a chance to become curious about it, learn some, and begin to like it before bad teachers ruin it for them with endless drilling. And this I believe to be really important.,: Answering some common arguments.,You are wrong. It's irrational and you're not used to owning irrational amounts of money that cannot be precisely changed into lower denominations. It's still possible.,Let's say we have no such denominations, and I ask  euros for a watermelon. It's in no way an ""impossible"" price, just inconvenient. We'll simply have to agree on a price that's close enough to be acceptable for both of us (maybe we'll use other currencies, maybe you'll give me 3.15 and I'll return you a cent in a few years when the approximately 0.0084 euros I owe you inflate, maybe I'll feel generous and accept your 3.14).,Duh! I know. If you want my mind changed please give me a concrete estimate (it could be back-of-the envelope calculation with explanations) how bad it would be. Let's say the US issue $1 billion worth of  dollar bills, if you demonstrate that it's so inconvenient it'll effectively cost another billion per year, then yeah, it's worse than I thought.,Note that I am not proposing to adjust banking and accounting systems. I guess you can pretend "" dollars"" is just a different currency and circumvent a lot of problems, but it still looks pretty inconvenient. At some point rounding has to happen, so banks and accounting systems can use rounded values.,That's a good argument if you provide an estimate how much it's going to cost. Without the estimate I'll probably work it out myself at some point, and maybe retroactively award deltas to those who brought it up first.,Clearly no country ever tried it. Probably there isn't even research into anything similar enough. So I will necessarily use low standards for evidence, but ""I think so"" just doesn't cut it. IDK what it can be, sufficiently similar situations that already happened? Somewhat related research? Pure logic? Maybe, maybe, maybe.,There were other good arguments (and must be more, I haven't yet read all), thanks to everyone.,:,1) My main argument that the denomination will get kids interested is dubious: I didn't fully appreciate that it's annoying and that applies to the kids as well, if they are forced to use it. ,2) The UK apparently paid quite a lot to get rid of shillings and Â£1/240 pence in 1966-1971. So it's possible that adding an inconvenient denomination will cost more than I expect, and it's probable that the inconvenience and annoyance matter more than I think.,3) And it looks like within a decade some countries will get rid of their cash altogether. It's probably where all developed world is headed."
"CMV: Trans activists who claim it is transphobic to not want to engage in romatic and/or sexual relationships with trans people are furthering the same entitled attitude as ""incel"" men, and are dangerously confused about the concept of consent.",Amiller1776,Removed - Submission Rule B,"1,501","2,381","Several trans activist youtubers have posted videos explaining that its not ok for cis-hetero people to reject them ""just because they're trans"".,When you unpack this concept, it boils down to one thing - these people dont seem to think you have an absolute and inalienable right to say no to sex. Like the ""incel"" croud, their concept of consent is clouded by a misconception that they are owed sex. So when a straight man says ""sorry, but I'm only interested in cis women"", his right to say ""no"" suddenly becomes invalid in their eyes.,This mind set is dangerous, and has a very rapey vibe, and has no place in today's society. It is also very hypocritical as people who tend to promote this idea are also quick to jump on board the #metoo movement.,My keys points are: 1) This concept is dangerous on the small scale due to its glossing over the concept of consent, and the grievous social repercussions that can result from being labeled as any kind of phobic person. It could incourage individuals to be pressured into traumatic sexual experiances they would normally vehemently oppose.,2) This concept is both dangerous, and counterproductive on the large scale and if taken too far, could have a negative effect on women, since the same logic could be applied both ways. (Again, see the similarity between them and ""incel"" men who assume sex is owed to them).,3) These people who promote this concept should be taken seriously, but should be openly opposed by everyone who encounters their videos.,I do not assume all trans people hold this view, and have nothing against those willing to live and let live. ,I will not respond to ""you just hate trans people"". I will respond to arguments about how I may be wrong about the consequences of this belief.,Edit: To the people saying its ok to reject trans people as individuals, but its transphobic to reject trans people categorically - I argue 2 points.
1) that it is not transphobic to decline a sexual relationship with someone who is transgendered. Even if they have had the surgery, and even if they ""pass"" as the oposite sex. You can still say ""I don't date transgendered people. Period."" And that is not transphobic. Transphobic behavior would be refusing them employment or housing oportunities, or making fun of them, or harassing them. Simply declining a personal relationship is not a high enough standard for such a stigmatized title.,2) Whether its transphobic or not is no ones business, and not worth objection. If it was a given that it was transphobic to reject such a relatipnship (it is not a given, but for point 2 lets say that it is) then it would still be morally wrong to make that a point of contention, because it brings into the discussion an expectation that people must , their lack of consent. No just meams no, and you dont get to make people feel bad over why. Doing so is just another way of pressuring them to say yes - whether you intend for that to happen or not, it is still what you're doing."

These days, feminism seems to focus on no longer finding equality between men and women but rather on making women superior to men - especially women in already privileged positions.,These days, companies feel pressured to reserve top management positions for women regardless of whether they are actually the best possible match for that position. Universities organize events where the first speaker has to be female, and if no other woman has anything to say, the discussion is over, regardless how many men had something to add. Feminism strongly lobbies to ""believe women"" making accusations against men in court, essentially trying to turn ""innocent until proven guilty"" on its head.,Much of modern feminism works to the benefit of already privileged women - of high education, financially well-endowed, or from groups of high social standings like Hollywood actresses, who lament that they are paid less than their male counterparts while ignoring that they are paid massively better than the majority of , and Hollywood these days produces an historically unseen number of movies selling the point that women are better than man but constantly held back by them.,And don't get me started about #metoo. The entire #metoo movement seems to only exist to blur the lines between rape and simple annoying behavior. Catcalling is supposedly ""sexual assault"", and an awkwardly placed compliment can lead to social destruction. Feminism claims that if an act makes a woman feel uncomfortable, it was sexist in itself and ought to be punished. If the distinction between flirting and sexual assault is based entirely on how the interaction made the woman feel, how does this promote equality between the sexes?,Feminism these days has done away with the idea that men and women should be equals and rather promotes the idea of female superiority just like racists promote the idea of white superiority.,*edit*,My view on this has been changed in a few ways.,I accept that ""feminism"" as a whole is more than misandry and the promotion of female supremacy, even today. There are feminists striving for equity and feminists in the West who care about actual struggles women face in less developed countries.,My point is that the most visible, most , feminists these days are those promoting what I am trying to describe in my CMV, and they are getting plenty of positive media attention and recognition in universities and businesses. The few people from the feminist spectrum speaking out against them are often dismissed as right-wing conservatives hiding their backwards agenda underneath a feminist mantle.,So you can read my CMV as ""The feminism currently promoted widely as progressive in the Western world is no longer about equality"""
CMV: Trans women are only women if they fully transition and live as a woman for at least a year,PinkNinjaKitty,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,167,"Edit #2 7/26: , pointed something out to me. Since some women do not have breasts because of genetic anomalies and, because of androgen insensitivity, some self-identified women dont have regular vagina/female parts, I cant require breasts and female genitalia as an example of what it means to be a woman. That only leaves a weak argument of needing female levels of estrogen and a lived experience as a woman for an arbitrary time period. My point of view is changed; I have to consider what I , think, but I know what I no longer believe. Thanks to everyone who talked to me. ,Edit: Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to discuss this issue with me. I'm still thinking through my point of view so I can't award any deltas. I can say that my original ""lived as a woman for at least a year"" is not a very strong argument. I'm trying to express that a woman needs lived experience for some time period, but a year is arbitrary. Also as always I'd like to emphasize that wherever an individual is in their life and wherever a trans person is in their transition, they deserve respect and compassion, and by discussing this subject I want to make it clear that it's meant to be a factual discussion and not a discriminatory one. The world needs more kindness.,Original post:,My views on this subject are not set in stone, so I'd like to discuss them and possibly have them changed. I've been thinking and reading a lot and, among other changing opinions, come to believe that it doesn't make sense for a trans woman to say that she's a woman unless she's fully transitioned and lived as a woman for at least a year. By ""fully transitioned"" I mean that she has 1) started taking estrogen, 2) had breast implants, 3) had a vaginoplasty. By ""lived as a woman for at least a year"" I mean that she has adopted a female social persona -- she uses a non-male name and non-male pronouns (like, say, Jenny or Katie or Alex and she/her), dresses in non-male clothes (dresses, jeans, shirts, bras if needed, etc), and generally presents as a female. She may not ""pass"" all of the time, but she tries.,I feel that fully transitioning and living as a woman for at least a year are important for this reason: Women are not women only because they feel like they are women. Most of the information I read said that they're not sure how to define or describe ""feeling like a woman,"" and as a biological woman myself, I don't know how to describe feeling like a woman. But women have some common lived experiences that men do not have. Those we can point to and say, this makes me feel like a woman.,Biological experiences: waking up to breasts and women's genitals; experiencing mood swings and pain and discharge during our periods; the knowledge that someday we may carry a baby inside of us; medical concerns such as breast cancer and uterine cancer.,Cultural/social experiences, which are more variable: encouraged to improve our bodies in the pursuit of beauty; encouraged to take a more passive role in dating and other areas of life; encouraged to pursue harmony and sweetness; experiencing social acceptance when crying openly; being the target of sexual harassment, molestation, and rape at a greater rate than men.,Just as a biological woman is not a woman because she feels like she is, a trans woman is not a woman because she feels like she is a woman, either. She doesn't have XX chromosomes and was not born a woman and has no female biological experiences and can't feel like a woman biologically until she starts hormone therapy and alters her body so that it has a woman's breast and genitals. She has usually been raised as a male and there are many small and large elements of socialization and culture that have passed her by. Living for at least a year as a woman will allow her to start to experience those cultural and social elements and live life as a woman in all its complexity.,My thoughts are a little bit rough and I'm still thinking through the subject, but it seems to me that a trans woman has to fully transition and live as a woman for at least a year before she can be called a woman."
CMV:Republicans have never passed a law that benefited the middle and/or lower class that did not favor the elite wealthy.,minion531,Removed - Submission Rule B,441,548,"I am now 58 years old and started my political life at age 18 as a Republican. Back then we called ourselves ""The Young Republicans"". At the time the US House of Representatives had been in control of the Democrats for almost 40 years. While I had been raised in a liberal household, I felt let down by the Democratic leadership. When I graduated high school inflation was 14%, unemployment was 12%, and the Feds discount rate was 22%. That's the rates banks charge each other. It's the cheapest rate available. So I voted for Reagan and the republican ticket.,Reagan got in, deregulated oil, gave the rich a huge tax cut and started gutting the Federal Government of regulations. Debt and deficits went up while the country went into a huge recession. And since then we have seen it play out time after time. Republicans get in charge and give the rich huge tax cuts, run up the debt and deficit, then call to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for all their deficit spending on wars and tax cuts.  I finally realized the Republicans were full of crap when Bush got elected, and the deficit spending broke records. But wages were stalled as the stock market went from 3000 to 12,000 on the Dow Jones.,Clinton raised taxes on the rich, and the debt and deficits went down. We prospered as a Nation during the Clinton years with what was the largest economic expansion in US history, at that time. We were actually paying our debt down. But Bush got in and again cut  taxes for the rich, twice, and again huge deficits. Add to that two wars that cost us $6.5 Trillion and counting. ,So change my mind. Tell me any law or set of laws the Republicans ever passed into law that favored the middle class over the wealthy class. Because in my 58 years, it's never happened that I know of."

CMV: Men should have right to relinquish all their parental rights and responsibilities,Z7-852,Removed - Submission Rule B,176,402,"I belong in pro-choice camp. I have strong belief that women have right to their own body and health. This means that every woman should have right to abort unwanted pregnancy (in reasonable time like 24 week). This is a topic that have been discussed long and thoroughly in this subreddit so I wont engage in any pro-life conversation. Everything I write after this is conditional to womens having right and access to abortion.,But in name of equality I believe that men should also have right to abort fatherhood. They cannot force women to have a child so women shouldnt have power to force men to have unwanted child. And because abortion is undisputable womens right men shouldnt be able to abort pregnancy but they should have right to relinquish all their parental rights and responsibilities.,In practice this would mean that once a man is informed that he is becoming a father, they should have two week period to write and submit one-sided legal document where they give up all their parental rights (visitation rights, choose religion or education etc.) and responsibilities (ie. financial support, inheritance). Its like they dont exist at all. Its important to note that this should be done after man is informed of fatherhood. This because someone might want to carry the pregnancy and tell after the birth and some women tell during the pregnancy.,Deeper dive to this topic have found more supporting arguments for this. One that I want to edit into this topic is financial competition related to paper abortion. Because abortion cost money and can be harmful men should shoulder some of this burden. This why I would also recommend that men should pay some if not all the medical cost of abortion. But abortion in general should be freely available to everyone so this shouldn't be a big issue. If woman wants to keep the child they would pocket this compensation.,Only issue that I have found in this model is children rights. Children have right to know their biological parents. But in this case I would use same legislation as in case of adoption where parent have voluntary consent for termination of parental rights.,To change my view show how either mens right to relinquish all their parental rights is not equal to womens right for abortion in this regard or case where men should be forced to hold their parental rights and responsibilities against their will.,Dont try to argue men should think this before getting girl pregnant because this argument doesnt allow women to have right for abortion (something that I think as a fundamental right). I will edit this post and add argument and counter arguments after this partition."
CMV: Companies should not be bailed out; they should be nationalized or go bankrupt,sober2ndthought,Removed - Submission Rule B,241,150,"So it's likely we are gonna see another around of bailouts across the board. Maybe there in argument to be made this time around it makes sense cause it's by natural disaster. Ok so maybe this time it is ok. ,But I am gonna make a general comment about bailouts. ,In the past 40 years bailouts have become more common, as a result government services have been extensively cut back. ,I believe before a company is bailed out, it should first go through the bankruptcy process. ,If the company is sufficiently necessary to the wider society that it's failure would cause a cascading failures in the wider economy, then that company should be nationalized not bailed out.  ,Before you say dead corporations, and lost jobs, you should realize this is not true in all bankruptcies. ,Bankruptcy is a process by which a company can restructure its debts, and move forward as a leaner and healthier company. ,Liquidation is where a company has failed.,Businesses go bankrupt all the time. Those businesses which still have a viable market can emerge stronger from the bankruptcy process. They'll have less bad debt and will have another opportunity to grow. ,Those which do not will go into liquidation, and they will either be replaced by its competitors or that market will disappear.,Businesses regularly recover from bankruptcy. ,During that short period where the company is struggling, sure employees suffer, but in the long run, employees are better off. ,For example if the company had a pension, the pension fund usually takes a greater stake in the company and as a result employees end up owning more equity in the company.,Equity trades can also be used in exchange for benefits or changes to the contract to reduce the corporation's operating expenses. ,While those that don't, yes they die out, but maybe they are meant to die out and create room for new companies to fill the void. ,What should be clear in a bankruptcy the parties which always loose are unsecured creditors. These are usually large institutional investors who take a risk in investing in the company. If the risk pays off the investors get rich, if it does not they loose their investment. ,The crux of my argument is this, public utilities work on a different social contract than private companies.,Public utilities run at a loss in exchange for the social benefit. The underlying premise being, the social benefit greatly outweighs the loss. ,Attempting to run the public utility profitably would destroy the social benefit and that's why public utilities are subsidized by the state. ,For example public transit the deal is it operates at a loss, but in exchange we get , less pollution, an effective means of transportation and less traffic. If we ran public transit profitably we might have to cut routes which are less profitable but still necessary for a functioning city.,When I hear the argument too big to fail, that makes me think that company should be run by the state. I mean if it's failure would cause bigger problems then it's effectively public utility. ,Private investors invest in large corporations and when they do, they sign onto a different social contract. ,The social contract is simple, we want you to take some risk, so that we can grow the business and create real meaningful value in the economy. ,In exchange for taking that risk, we have offered you certain benefits:,But it is understood you always loose what you invested in the company when the company fails. ,If we keep bailing out bad investments, we are actually destroying that social contract.,Now when the risk pays off the investor keeps a greater share of the profit and enjoys favourable tax treatment. But when the business fails the investor is bailed out. ,This is encouraging investors to make even worse investments. If the company is big enough it wont be allowed to fail investors take more risks with the companies they run. If the the risk pays off the investor gets richer, but I'd it doesn't the investor is nailed out and is no poorer. ,It is also creating a set of zombie companies. Those companies are saddled with bad debt, and are constantly and are paying off that bad debt. As a result, few companies can afford to make investments in the company itself such as giving their employees higher wages or hire new employees.,As a result it's creating more wealth inequality between those who have money and those who do not. ,As governments bail out more and more, government debt rises. As governments try to finance that government debut, public services start to suffer, which again affects those of us at the bottom the most."

All Kyle was guilty of was the misdemeanor of possessing a gun while being underage. Yes this is a minor crime bit the man who chased him was also guilty of a misdeanenor (staying out past curfew).,Myth two: the man who chased Kyle may have thought his life was in dangger which is why he chased Kyle and lunged at him trying to take his gun.,Truth: The thing is Kyle was trying to escape the situation and was fleeing.

CMV: The religious establishment in the United States is corrupt and lost their way.,chloeandvegas,Removed - Submission Rule B,25,122,"So I just got into an argument with someone the other day about this and I wanna see what yall think. Now I think the Christian establishment has grown corrupt and lost their way. Theyve become shills for social conservatism and diverged from what the religion was originally meant to be. We have many struggling poor people in the US yet all you guys care about is fighting abortion and Gay marriage in court battles and opposing LGBTQ rights in culture wars. Yall are the ones making Christianity look bad and driving people to atheism. The Bible never says to use the government to write blue laws that impose your personal beliefs on others, but it does command you help the poor. How about helping out the people in your area. (Most) Churches dont do this that much. Youll be surprised what the Christian community can do when we set our minds to something. Missionary work is one thing that I think the church is doing right. Cant that be a model for helping the poor? Which will improve the reputation of our faith thus reinforcing the missionaries and expanding the faith.,So I think that we should be like Jesus and shatter the religious establishment. Jesus opposed and stood up to the Pharisees, who were the corrupt religious establishment of his day. We should do the same and force some much needed reform."

CMV: If someone claims to be a Sanders supporter who is unwilling to vote for Biden then its almost a certainty that they are lying about their support or are misinformed about Bernie,Ten_Godzillas,Removed - Submission Rule B,11,94,"In both this primary, last primary, and throughout the last general election, Bernie Sanders encouraged all of his supporters to vote for the Democratic nominee,Bernie endorsed Hillary in in 2016 and, if he hasn't done so yet, will almost certainly endorse Biden as well.,So for a former Sanders voter to take the position that Biden is 'more of the same', 'Just as bad as Trump', 'REEEEE HES GOT DIMENSIA!!!' or to spread uncorroborated and uninvestigated claims/conspiracies requires MASSIVE cognitive dissonance and mental gymnastics. ,My personal opinion of these people is that most of them are lying about their previous support for Sanders to try and sway anyone who might actually believe their bullshit. ,Also, whenever these bad-faith actors inevitably convince , Bernie supporters of their bullshit it's almost a certainty that they weren't fully informed of what Bernie Sanders advocated for and what he wants next for his movement.,Dropping out of the next presidential election would be turning your back on Bernie and would effectively be renouncing your support for his movement. His movement didn't end when he suspended his campaign; he's still going to fight for progressive causes and encouraging his supporters to back Joe Biden is exactly that. ,In short, saying 'I supported Bernie but i won't vote for Biden because X' means one of the following must also be true: ,Full disclosure: I voted for Bernie in both the 2016 and 2020 primaries.

CMV: Differences in IQ between races are significantly genetic in origin.,adjectivesrumble,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,102,"I believe this is true for groups like Jews, East Asians, whites, and blacks.,I believe this because genetics (due to common ancestry) seems to be a common factor, even when environmental factors are very different such as living in different countries, different periods in history, or growing up in different race families. Although environmental factors such as the economy of a country or childhood experiences also have a big contribution to IQ, that doesn't seem to persist to the children of those people born in a better environment. An example of this is Jewish immigrants to America in the late 1800s had lower than normal IQs but the subsequent generation (born in America) were higher than normal, as I would expect from their race.,Races - These race classifications are broad, inconsistently defined and include many different, even unrelated ethnic groups so it's not an ideal way to classify people. However, they do roughly classify people with similar ancestry together in the same group so they're not meaningless. A lot of data is only known to that level of coarseness and that's also a level where the IQ differences are consistently apparent so it's sufficient.,Valid studies showing it's wrong. It should not have any obvious flaws such as small sample size, important uncontrolled variables or cherry picking.,Examples of populations that go against my claim, such as finding a country with a black population having the same average IQ as, say whites in America. It should be a population representative of the common meaning of these race classifications not one with an obvious bias such as comparing black university graduates to all white people.,- Showing that environmental factors are significant without also showing that genetic factors are not.,- Pointing out that we haven't found the genes for intelligence.,- Evidence of some intervention that increases IQ during childhood without also showing that the change persists past teenage age.,- Claiming that race is a social construct. It is, but it also contains information about genetically similar groups. For this to change my view, you would have to show that it's independent of genetics."
CMV: The BLM movement intentionally picks flawed police brutality incidents to intensify backlash.,shannow86,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,83,"Cases like Michael Brown, Jacob Blake, and Breonna Taylor become rallying cries. Cases are presented as senseless police brutality committed by cops who wake up in the morning and just want to kill a black dude when the actual details show a very different and morally ambiguous picture. I am crystal clear on the fact that our country has become a police state that does systemically target minorities but I can't see hard evidence that it boils down to individual cops.,I believe that leaders in the BLM movement pay lip service to the likes Philando Castille and Tamir Rice, where there is clear evidence that the individual cops involved were likely bigotted, and reserve full vitriol and calls to action for the less cut-and-dry examples. This is done so they can vilify anyone who talks about the details of a situation and call them racist bootlickers who are no better than the ""blue lives matter"" crowd. There is a lot of value in having massive backlash to your movement that blurs the line between actual racists and people who just want to know facts to make sure truly bad actors are held accountable. In short, having more people against you gives you a bigger pool to tar with your chosen moniker and actually brings more people to your side as fence sitters are afraid to be wrong and wind up having to choose.,This is a short-sighted way to go about achieving change. It causes people to be afraid to state how they feel for fear of backlash and makes it very complicated to understand where people actually stand. That is the reason we got Trump -- people will say the right things publicly while not truly believing it and make different choices when they feel as though they are anonymous. ,Recently we've seen ambushes of police officers in a few states. That will harden attitudes towards a movement that will not outright condemn it. Say what you will about the violence of the state being ignored while individual acts of defiance are highlighted; I do understand that point, but it doesn't matter. At the end of the day people want to feel safe. It is fundamental to emotional health. People innately feel that if a cop can be attacked like that, a normal person is not safe.,So, CMV.

"CMV: The ""system"" that needs to change in light of recent events is the American education system and Academia writ large.",Williamnotwillorbill,Removed - Submission Rule B,15,35,"Like most of the world, I have been taking a good, hard look at what needs to change in America in light of the George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, et al. cases. In the midst of research, a thought crossed my mind that I haven't been able to shake. This is all a failure of the American education system, teachers and academia as a whole for one of two reasons: ,EITHER ,1) The American education system, and teachers in particular, have acted in bad faith, knowingly teaching a false side of history, and intentionally leaving out the racism that runs through every fiber of the country to this day. This failure has continued to perpetuate the evils of this evil system at the expense of the poorest in the country, and people of color specifically. The outrageous events that have occurred in the last few months are nothing new, and the lack of fortitude to correctly teach the vast evils of this current system directly allows these types of events to continue. The vast majority of Americans grow up being taught and thinking that this country is a ""city of a hill,"" which comes directly from American school systems.,OR ,2) America really was founded on the ideas of freedom, individual liberty, and democracy, and a new way of living and thinking that valued human dignity and rights. No doubt, racism has existed throughout the history of the country, but history up until this point has been a continuous struggle in the right direction, towards liberty and justice for all. In fact, the foundational principles (and institutions) of the country have provided a fertile ground for social justice movements to enact real change. If this is the case, our educators are doing a tremendous disservice right now in allowing the narrative to be structured in a way that characterizes the country as inherently evil, and we need historians and teachers to stand up for truth. Allowing people to change history to fit their own narrative will destroy the oldest surviving democratic nation in the world, and allowing the loudest voice to define truth is tantamount to supporting fascism. ,,I really don't see any other way around it: ""Academia"" is to blame for recent events."
CMV: Most video games that advertise themselves as RPGs are not RPGs (or What is RPG).,Z7-852,Removed - Submission Rule B,7,59,"Now before anyone starts yelling gatekeeping or elitism calm down. Im trying to define term in such way that it is useful. If we allow some games to be defined as RPGs (when they arent) it makes term useless to describe anything because it wont mean anything. RPG becomes just a marketing buzzword. This is more an ontological discussion about what can and cannot be considered to be RPG. This discussion can be related to tabletop RPGs as well and in my conclusion,  I will tell you what tabletop RPGs are not true RPGs.,First, I will list games that I do consider to be true RPGs. Wither, Baldurs Gate, Deus Ex, Life is Strange are examples Im going to use.,Then there are games that are labeled as RPGs but are not. These are fake RPGs. PokÃ©mon, Diablo, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls are some examples.,Then there are games that are not RPGs and are not labeled as such. Doom (2016), Tomb Raider, FIFA series.,Next, I will open up , and start debunking characteristics it lists to be in RPG definition., Almost all games have some story and setting. Doom have story and setting. Space invaders has story and setting. Story alone doesnt make game an RPG. Now arguments that story must be good or a major element are both subjective and cannot be standard for definition. There are bad RPGs with bad or uninteresting stories but that doesnt make them any less RPGs., Nowadays almost all games have XP and level ups. FIFA has level ups. Tomb Raider lets you customize your character based on your play style as you level up. Leveling up is Sisyphus exercise that has nothing to do with RPGs. Life Is Strange is a RPG that lacks this aspect and is still a RPG. Also linked to this is character creation or picking a class. Wither doesnt let you pick your class, but Overwatch does. Character creation is again not a common factor., Lot of games recycle game play mechanics like inventory or quests. Then there are again RPGs that doesnt use these elements. Same goes for combat mechanics or random dice rolls., Now we are getting close to the true answer. If you can start game dozens of times and have good time with it has good replay value. All (good) RPGs have this in common but also games like Tetris has great replay value. To figure out why RPGs have such a high replay value we have to figure out what makes a true RPG., Is one and only aspect that is common with all the RPGs and lacks from fake RPGs and no-RPGs alike. If there are multiple choices that impact the game world in meaningful way leading to either multiple endings for main story or single quest, then you have made an roleplaying choice. It doesnt matter what character you pick in Diablo or what PokÃ©mons you use. It doesnt matter how you level up in Tomb Raider or how you kill in Doom. The game will go on as scripted and everyone will experience the same dialog and same story. In tabletop RPGs this is called , and this is hallmark of bad RPG to the point that I wouldnt call games with railroading to be RPGs at all. In true RPGs you can pick a role (for example good or evil) and change the world. In tabletop setting this is easy to accommodate (because you can invent anything and change anything) but in video games you must code everything. This makes video games RPGs more limited in choices but only if your choices really matter are they import. Otherwise it would be just an illusion of choice.,Now I dont want to sound like pompous elitist when talking about RPGs and therefore I want my view to be changed or challenged. I think defining this term correctly is import because if we allow PokÃ©mon or Dark Souls to be RPGs then FIFA and Doom are also RPGs and the term is essentially meaningless."
CMV: Telling someone to watch what they drink/wear (to avoid getting raped) is no different than telling someone to lock their door (to avoid getting robbed),Agentbolt,Removed - Submission Rule B,198,347,"edit: It has been pointed out that I'm including two entirely different things in this analogy (wearing revealing clothing vs. drinking) and the ""wearing"" analogy doesn't really hold up. So in this example, I'm solely referring to drinking, and I apologize for indicating otherwise. ,If I get robbed because I left my doors unlocked, that is not my fault. The police might ask if I locked up, and people might wonder why I was being careless, but the indisputable fact is that the person who robbed my house is the only one to blame for the situation. ,I don't see how this is any different than suggesting women be careful what they drink while in mixed company. Women shouldn't HAVE to do this (any more than I should HAVE to lock my door) but we don't live in a world where everyone does exactly what they're supposed to. Therefore, it's not a victim-blaming or misguided idea to protect myself against those people. There are bad people out there. Some of them want to rob me, some of them want to rape me. These people KNOW they're bad, they just don't care. ,I, as a rational adult, know that it's not realistic to go around demanding people stop suggesting I lock my doors, because they're engaging in victim blaming. We have locks on our doors, and have had them pretty much since doors were invented, because it's simply a logical protection to have against bad people.,Again, if I get robbed, it is NOT my fault. If they catch the robber, he's not going to be able to use ""well he had his doors unlocked!"" as any kind of excuse. But, having said that, there are proactive steps I can take to lessen the danger of someone taking advantage of me. That isn't changing anything about what the potential robber might attempt to do, it's just a way I can prevent myself from being put in a position to be robbed in the first place. "
CMV: Biden and Harris are the worst candidates in today's BLM movement,IrrationalFalcon,Removed - Submission Rule B,1,23,"One of the things that pisses me off is how the Democrats call Trump and the Republicans racist, while also pushing two candidates who have contributed to the very problem we have today. ,I'm not going to say Trump is less racist than the Dems. What I am saying is that the Democrats cannot say ""we support BLM and minorities"" while picking a racist and a woman who supported the death penalty and putting black men in jail. There's a reason her support plummeted after being , for this. She clearly didn't have the support to be president, yet Biden chose her because he wanted to appease the black voters. The dems don't care about us,I also want to say that Harris isn't just black. She's also half Asian. I have not seen the Democrats or anyone really say that Harris is Indian. The reason for this is that black people are a more significant minority than Asians, thus it's beneficial for the Democrats to push Harris as being black as opposed to being half black and half Asian. The latter is rather pedantic, but I think it's important to show that the Democrats are trying to profit off of the current turmoil as opposed to actually making change. ,We had candidates who were more vocally supportive of the black community, LGBTQ+ community, yet they were pushed to the backburner. ,I'm here because I actually want a debate and, since it looks like Biden will win, I need to feel assured that I misjudged them. I cannot support these two candidates with a good conscience at all."
CMV: Impeachment is a trap that will wound the democrats and increase the chances of a Trump second term,secondsniglet,Removed - Submission Rule B,4,83,"Until now the democratic party leadership has wisely chosen not to officially open impeachment proceedings, and instead focus on doing investigations that could build a foundation of evidence capable of shaping public opinion in support of impeachment. Democratic party leaders have understood that impeachment will fail unless a larger share of Americans support the effort. The consequences of a failed impeachment proceeding, where the President remains in office, can result in significant blow back for the party bringing the charges. Thus, it is very important to wait until there is broad support for impeachment before starting the process.,Unfortunately, the recent decision to officially begin impeachment investigations is premature and unlikely to result in significantly changing the minds of anyone who was already not in support of impeachment. There is no smoking gun in Ukraine scandal evidence that proves a quid pro quo sufficiently that it would convince people who previously didnt support impeachment to do so now. In fact, the evidence for the Ukraine extortion scandal shows that Trump was very careful to couch things in terms that can be interpreted as reasonable statecraft by people who wish to do so. This kind of doublespeak is sufficient to keep American voters who have not previously supported impeachment from changing their minds.,This has created an impeachment trap for the democrats, a trap which they have now jumped into. Because the evidence available is too weak to move the needle on public support for impeachment it is highly likely that the senate will fail to convict the President. The democractic party will then suffer from voters upset they overplayed their hand and disrupted the nation with impeachment proceedings that went nowhere.,In fact, the democrats have now handed Trump a gift, allowing him to use their failed impeachment attempt as a campaign issue, chastising them for partisan rancor and vengeful behavior."
CMV: Two handed swords are mostly pointless.,Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,73,"In just about every situation, a one handed sword is better than a two handed one.,Military use.,If you are in the military, chances are you are not using a sword as a primary weapon and if you were, you would be better served having a shield than the few extra inches of reach a two handed sword grants. The shield gives you something to hide behind in case of projectile attack and lets you block and attack at the same time.,If you end up having to fight a heavily armored opponents, swords are just bad in general, but a one handed sword is slightly less bad. Grappling ends up being a big part of armored combat, having a hand free helps with that. Once the enemy is on the ground, the shorter blade is proportionally more rigid and easier to control, letting you try to finish the opponent off a bit better. But keep in mind both are still bad, a pole axe would be leagues better than both.,Furthermore one handed swords seem to be the only option for cavalry.,Civilian use.,The primary purposes of a sword for a civilian are as a status symbol (in which case anything will do with enough decoration), a deterrent to robbery (where being visibly armed is all it will take) or dueling (where you almost always used matched weapons, so it doesn't matter what you use. On the off chance you get to bring your own sword, rapiers, proved to be the best in that context anyway, that long reach, hand protection and nimble blade proved hard to beat).,On the off chance you found yourself forced to defend your town from bandits, the same issues with two handed swords in military use apply. Either get a shield, or use a spear with your sword as a backup."
CMV: High school and Uni should be like gym,BeatriceBernardo,Removed - Submission Rule B,5,106,"I'm just going to present an alternative, and I'm looking for reason why the alternative is not, at least, on average, equally as good. I'm not going to be convinced if your argument is like: it is worse for a specific 10%, but better for another 10%. Or it is equally bad as the current ones. Or, it is worse for 20%, but twice as good for 10%. It has to be worst, on average, for you to convince me. Anyway, here I go:,In gym, there are equipment available, and classes. Once you pay for the membership, you can use the equipment as long as the gym is open, and join classes when they are available (you might have to queue for popular classes). Why can't high school & uni be like this? You pay a monthly fee, you have free access to the library + online journals + recorded lectures + lecture notes + practice questions + online paid learning service such as brilliant.com / great courses plus. In addition, you can join scheduled lecture + workshop + tutorials. You can go to a study area filled with paid / volunteer tutor. Once you're ready, you pay an extra bit to take exams, to start assignments / projects.,You learn at your own pace, you take assessment at your own pace. The tutor/lecturer teach at their own pace with their own style. If they always get a full room, they might be given a larger lecture hall, and even a pay rise, or else, they will go to another university, or get their own event organizer. If a lecturer / tutor / teacher always gets a an empty class, kick them out.,As long as the assessment is fair, employer would trust the certificates. ,I think, after many conversations, I know how to present my answer better: ,. There are many pro and cons of online and traditional learning. I want the best of both world. You  have everything you want to have in online learning. Plus, you have optional offline learning as well like lectures, tutors, workshops, academic advisers, counseling, libraries, students groups, etc2. The key word here, is that the offline parts are optional. This is the part that is like a 'gym'.,However, to maintain credibility, the assessment is fully offline. However,,Assessment will take all forms, from test, take home long essays, to individual and group projects. The specific question will be different all the time, Thus, you cannot start an assessment early, because you won't know the specifics of the tasks. You will have to pay a bit extra for test (like SAT),Here's an example of project as assessment in my system: ,Here's an example why my systems would be better:,Regarding education being publicly funded: ,I will be crediting deltas to all who have helped me sharpened my ideas."

CMV: women are the more privileged gender,Bluefish178,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,185,"Now, Im not going to debate all the other 76 genders or what ever, Im talking about men vs women. I havent heard any legal or statistical reason women are oppressed. None. Here is a link to a fantastic article with some of the disadvantages of being a man in America (although Im sure some of his applies in other 1st world countries) ,
Id say custody rights, child support, suicide rates, male rape, homelessness, male circumcision, and longer prison sentences are some of the biggest mens problems. Change my view. Edit:I would like to slightly adjust my view. Women are privileged or equal to men. Just to clarify
 edit 2: the burden of proof is on you. Im saying women arent oppressed, you need to prove they are. Ive read a lot of comments trying to place the burden on me, which is not the case. You have to prove to me that women are oppressed, I dont have to prove the arent. Thank you, and have a nice day."
"CMV: ""Pre-paying"" for children would be the only system which doesn't create perverse incentives nor punish kids.",kabukistar,Removed - Submission Rule B,1,183,"The way the system is set up now, with regards to childbirth, is that people who choose to have kids can have that choice subsidized, though things like TANF, WIC, and child support.  This creates a situation where people are basically paid to have children, and where we (as a society) are paying to increase the population.   ,If we just dropped all of these programs, though, it would stop the incentives but it would also punish children.  If someone decides to have a kid they cannot afford, it is wrong to make everyone else pay for it, but it is also wrong to make the kid suffer for it.  So there would be a huge problem of children essentially suffering from their parents' poor choices.  There's some extent of this in the system already, because, even when parents receive these extra resources, they sometimes spend them on their own wants rather than their children's needs.  And sometimes they are not enough to meet the needs of the kids.,There is only one system I can think of that does not have the problem of punishing children nor of subsidizing procreation: pre-paying for kids.  That is to say, summing up the costs of necessities for children (food, clothing, medical case/insurance, education, everything that costs money and kids need to have a healthy upbringing), and every potential parent is required to pre-pay that amount before having children.  Then, after you have a kid, all of those things are paid for until that child reaches 18.  This makes sure that your child never goes hungry, or without medical care or anything else they need, but at the same time does not pay adults to have children.  As far as I can tell, this is the only system that would meet these two goals, and I cannot think of another.,How you can change my view: talk about a different way to handle things that would not create perverse incentives nor punish children for their parent's poor choices.,CMV."
"CMV: If the Republican party disbanded, the US would be better off",Throw_Away_Obvi_,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,76,"By ""Republican party"", I mean the politicians, their regular supporters, the media that backs them (e.g. Fox, Breitbart), the ""think tanks"" that support them (e.g. Heritage Foundation) and their donors (e.g. Koch brothers (iirc)). By disband, I mean they drop out of political life, don't vote and don't donate to or campaign for any political issues. Effectively stopping themselves from influencing US politics.,This sounds extreme but as someone looking at the GOP from outside the US, I can't see what actual benefit it brings to America. It worsens income inequality, sabotages fights against racism, sexism, climate change and efforts to improve healthcare, it seems increasingly illiberal (like Russian parties) with practices like gerrymandering, weakens the economy, responds aggressively to most international problems and misleads huge parts of the US population (e.g. 'Obama is a Muslim', 'Climate change is fake'). On the positive side, it employs people directly and represents some odd views that are pretty interesting but I can't see how it improves the lives of Americans any more than the Democrats would.,To be clear, I'm not saying Conservatism is bad but extremism is and Republicans to qualify as extreme as they appear to have different values and a different basic understanding of the world than most other western democratic parties.,This assumes that Democrats would split along the Clinton-Sanders division (which seems likely) meaning America would have a genuine centre right and centre left party who are both trying to help Americans by using thought out methods rather than impose an ideology (e.g. Government healthcare is bad).,I would give deltas for convincing evidence that the current Republican party helps America and it's people in objective ways (e.g. makes them richer, safer, healthier, happier etc) to a greater extent than Democrats could/do and to the extent that it makes up for some of their negative influences."
CMV: People of African descent have inherently lower IQ.,X88B88bewbs,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,52,"I just had a long debate with my friend about this, and I came in with the thought that blacks and whites were genetically similar, but all the evidence seems to say otherwise. For example, African countries have horrible average IQs, and normally I would explain that with the fact that they're way less developed than the rest of the world. However, we can take a look at countries with similar or worse human development and see much better IQs, even Afghanistan has 84, which is much higher than the average African IQ. The southeast Asian countries would be another example of this, having similar HDI ratings, but much higher IQs.
,
The most damning evidence that really changed my mind was that according to a study by Minnesota university, black children adopted by white parents STILL have lower IQs than white kids adopted by white parents. Even worse is that children with one black parent, but adopted by two white parents have a higher IQ than children with two black parents, but less than children with two white parents.
wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study
It's really hard for me to believe that blacks have inherently lower IQs, and I really don't want to accept it. Plus the implications it has for society are huge, so I would really appreciate it if you guys could change my view."

CMV: I don't need to wear my glasses all the time and day-to-day they don't make that much of a difference.,AntiqueCurtains,Removed - Submission Rule B,0,14,"Recently found out that two colleagues have a lower prescription than me for their glasses. IIRC I am -1.75 and -2.00 in my left and right eye respectively. They wear their glasses all the time and are roughly .251.00 points lower than me in their prescriptions. They are glasses wearing people. I have seen one of them on a night out before without glasses, they had contacts in. Neither of them drive or require them for anything else daily AFAIK and meeting one of them out would give the impression that if they could, they wouldn't wear them. ,Day to day, I do not wear glasses. If I am going to a show where I will be far away from the action, like the cinema, sporting event, theatre, gig, hiking etc. I will bring them and wear them for when I am watching it. But if we move away from the showoff they come. Sometime I will wear them for a fashion look with whatever else I am wearing, and occasionally to make myself look more of an authority. Am a web dev, so feel it can help sometimes with particular clients.  ,Have never had any debilitating issues or events that made me think I should wear them more often. Yes, things away are blurrybut they are far away. If I need to, I can move closer. If I can't move closer, big deal. Someone can tell me what it is/happening/says. More often than not, there's no reason for me to have a sharper view of things.
